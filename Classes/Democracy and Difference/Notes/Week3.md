"The Condition of the Modern Man"

- The Human Condition, published in 1958, is one of the central theoretical works of the philosopher Hannah Arendt.
- It is an account of the historical development of the situation of human existence, from the Ancient Greeks to modern Europe.
- Arendt aims the book at the possibilities of the vita activa (the title she preferred) in the modern world.
- She defines the three activities – 
	- labor, 
	- work, 
	- action
- and describes four possible realms: 
	- the political, 
	- the social, 
	- the public, 
	- the private. 
- She then explains how the Ancient Greeks positioned each activity in each realm, and criticises the modern world from this standpoint.

I - The Human Conditions

- Arendt introduces the term vita activa (active life), by distinguishing it from vita contemplativa (contemplative life).
- Each term represents a vision of how life should be lived. 
- Vita activa was originally identical to the political actions of free citizen in the ancient Greek Polis.
- As this system of governance waned, so the meaning of political life got demoted to the concept of social life. This is evident in the distortion of Aristotle's definition of man as a "political animal" ("ὁ ἄνθρωπος φύσει πολιτικὸν ζῷον") which was translated as "social animal" by Seneca and medieval writers, while the word "social" did not exist in ancient Greek vocabulary.
- In the same manner, starting with Plato, philosophy began to see itself as following the vita contemplativa and aiming to experience the eternal, outside and above the political sphere.
- In introducing the term vita activa, Arendt aims to offer an alternative: attaining the immortal through a specific form of political life that is different from the social life that we all live by definition of being human. Explaining this is the subject of the book.
- The vita activa comprises three human activities – labor, work, and action – which correspond to the three basic conditions under which humans live.
- Arendt points out that the "human condition" and "human nature" are not synonymous.
	- Having the same or nearly the same meaning as another word or phrase in the same language.
- She draws a distinction between them by explaining that, if humans were to colonize the moon or some other planetary body, they would live under new conditions.
- Their human nature, however – if there is such a thing – would remain intact. Human nature is located within human beings; the human condition is not.

V - The Vita Activa and the Modern Age

- Arendt records the decline of what the Ancient Greeks understood as the Public Sphere, as a place where immortality can be attained through great works and lasting deeds.
- This happened mainly through a shift of focus from the immortality of the human world into abstract concepts of the mind, as the importance of the human senses as a source of objective knowledge about the world declined.
- "Cartesian doubt", as she calls the notion that a person's senses could be presenting him with a false world, an illusion, possibly created by some malevolent god (dieu trompeur), is best expressed in the phrase cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I exist), meaning that the only thing a person can be certain of is not the world around him but his own cognitive process.
- This great shift prepared the world for Galileo's heliocentric universe in which the possibility of attaining immortality through lasting deeds (Action) was completely lost.
- Arendt also observes the evolution of scientific thinking from the "world-bound" geometry of the ancient world, to the abstract concepts of algebra without which Newton could never have formulated his Universal Laws.

#### Personal Notes

- This paper focuses on the recent immigrant mobilizations and the heightened presence of politically active Latinos (documented and undocumented; non-citizens versus native-born) in the United States. 
- While other theorists have turned to Arendt’s analysis of statelessness and superfluity to consider questions of immigration, “illegality,” and the status of noncitizens, this essay argues that Arendt’s account of labor and her nonconsequentialist account of action offer a richer optic for considering the undocumented in the United States. 
- To explore this claim, this essay constructs an alternate account of the nationwide demonstrations for immigrant rights that occurred in 2006. Rather than defining “success” in terms of replicability or immediate legislative results, the author’s analysis of the 2006 protests emphasizes the significance of noncitizens laying claim to the public realm. 
- Considering Michael Warner’s concept of counterpublics, the author argues that the demonstrations can be best understood as a moment of initiation and an inaugural performance of the political. Rereading Arendt’s notion of animal laborans, the essay concludes by exploring the limitations of noncitizens invoking labor as a way to gain civic standing.
- The recent marches and rallies of undocumented immigrants in spring 2006 were a powerful reminder of the importance of publicly enacting ones civic identity. Yet this paper argues that such embodied forms of breaking silence pose enormous dangers, since the undocumented struggle with being collectively visible yet publicly undifferentiated. Drawing on Hannah Arendt's theories of labor action, the paper explores how issues of political action and racial visibility effect the political practices of the undocumented as they attempt to lay claim to the public realm.
