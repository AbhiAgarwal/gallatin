Context

- The text was written in 1754 in response to a prize competition of the Academy of Dijon answering the prompt: What is the origin of inequality among people, and is it authorized by natural law?
- The aim of the Discourse is to examine the foundations of inequality among men.
- To help determine whether this inequality is authorized by natural law.
- Moral inequality: It is created not by Nature but by a convention or agreement between consenting men
- Missing out: age is a consideration in inequality.

State of nature

- A condition before society and the development of reason.
- Rousseau attempts to conjecture, or guess, what man in this state would be like.
- Examines man's physical and mental characteristics, and finds him to be an animal like any other, motivated by two key principles: pity and self-preservation.
- Only real attribute that separates him from the animals is his perfectibility, a quality that is vitally important in the process Rousseau goes on to describe.
- Man in the state of nature has few needs, no idea of good and evil, and little contact with other humans. Nevertheless, he is happy.

Theory of Natural Human

- "The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said "This is mine," and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody." (Discourse on Inequality, 1754)
	- In common with other philosophers of the day, Rousseau looked to a hypothetical State of Nature as a normative guide.
	- Rousseau holds that "uncorrupted morals" prevail in the "state of nature" and he especially praised the admirable moderation of the Caribbeans in expressing the sexual urge despite the fact that they live in a hot climate, which "always seems to inflame the passions".

Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men

- Rousseau first exposes in this work his conception of a human state of nature, presented as a philosophical fiction (like by Thomas Hobbes, unlike by John Locke), and of human perfectibility, an early idea of progress.
- He then explains the way, according to him, people may have established civil society, which leads him to present private property as the original source and basis of all inequality.
	- Private property was the origin source and basis for all inequality.
- Rousseau's text is divided into four main parts: the dedication, the preface, an extended inquiry into the nature of the human being and another inquiry into the evolution of the human species within society.
- There is a set of writings that expound upon important issues that were brought up in the beginning of the text.
	- Rousseau discusses two types of inequality, natural or physical and ethical or political.
		- Natural inequality involves differences between one man's physical strength and that of another – it is a product of nature.
			- Rousseau is not concerned with this type of inequality and wishes to investigate moral inequality
		- He argues moral inequality is endemic to a civil society and relates to, and causes, differences in power and wealth.
			- This type of inequality is established by ***convention***
			- Rousseau appears to take a cynical view of civil society, where man has strayed from his "natural state" of isolation and consequent freedom to satisfy his individual needs and desires.
			- In the work, Rousseau concludes that civil society is a trick perpetrated by the powerful on the weak in order to maintain their power or wealth.
			- "The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said "This is mine," and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society." (109)
			- "From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody." (109)
		- The two fundamental principles of Rousseau's natural man are his natural, non-destructive love of self (amour de soi meme), and pity/compassion for the suffering of others ("another principle which has escaped Hobbes").
			- Pity and self-love, acting together, contribute to preserving the human species through time.
		- Unlike Hobbes's natural man, Rousseau's is not motivated by fear of death because he cannot conceive of that end, thus fear of death already suggests a movement out of the state of nature.
