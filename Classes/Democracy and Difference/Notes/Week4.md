### Sheldon Wolin. “Fugitive Democracy.” In Benhabib (ed.). Democracy and Difference (pp. 31-45)

#### Personal Notes

- Sheldon Wolin is associated with radical democracy, which is localist and participatory, but his own conception, at least since 2004, has been that democracy is "fugitive" by nature. By "fugitive democracy", Wolin means that democracy is constantly under threat, especially from the corporations who would seek to manage democracy to its own purposes (See "Democracy, Inc.).
- Democracy, in Wolin's view, cannot be coupled to static constitutional forms -- but is always dynamic at its margins. His concept of fugitive democracy has been questioned by critics as the "dark vision of a small town democrat," and as "unhinged postmodern theory." 
- But it has been Wolin's consistent, life-long project to decouple democracy from liberalism in all its institutional forms (political and economic). Thus "fugitive democracy" can properly be understood as the culmination of a lifetime of writing on democratic theory.
