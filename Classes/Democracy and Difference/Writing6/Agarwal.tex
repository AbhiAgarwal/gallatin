\par Prior to reading this I had no clue what the Jim Crow laws were. This is quite a huge gap in my historical knowledge - mostly because I did not ever study the American history. I was very surprised that I just heard about this - the population of people in prison now is actually very close to the population of people in prison during the Soviets. The Soviets had about 850 people in prison per 100,000 people while the United States has 800 people in prison per 100,000. This is quite bizarre to me as the Soviets had a large amount of prisoners because they were constantly under war. 
\par The metric I was shocked most by was the fact that African Americans constitute of 14\% of the American population, but 40\% of the prison population. She mentioned a couple factors that leads to this, but the biggest factor that I believe is most important is the fact that they rely on public defenders over highly rated defense attorneys. 
\par 

\par In conclusion, the rest of the world is very scared of the prison system in the United States and now I understand why. One thing that this book has made really clear is that people (both upper and middle class) seek to make a profit from racism.
