Reading Photography:

- Jennifer Tucker, "Photography as witness"

Quotes:

- "To understand the special burden of representation borne by photography as a witness in meteorology, however, we must reflect not just on the parallels that Victorians invoked between scientific photography and legal witnessing, but also on the impact of transformations in meteorology during the 1880s and 1890s on Victorian uses and perceptions of photographs as meteorological evidence" (Tucker, 384).
- "Were unexpected results of lightening photography evidence of nature, artifacts of technology, or the result of human nature?" (Tucker, 388).
- "Scientific photography built on the notion of objectivity, but neither atlases nor photographs escape judgment" (Tucker, 394).
