Reading Photography:

- Jennifer Tucker, "Photography as witness"

Quotes:

- "a photographer must 'prove his photograph' by expounding the manner in which it had been made before the image could be admitted as a matter of fact" (Tucker, 379).
- "Scholars have detailed the nineteenth century's belief in the power of photographic technology to replicate the act of unmediated seeing, to eliminate human prejudice and to minimize the errors that allegedly vitiated the objectivity of drawings" (Tucker, 380).
- "We cannot claim to have really seen anything before having photographed it" (Tucker, 380).
- "To understand the special burden of representation borne by photography as a witness in meteorology, however, we must reflect not just on the parallels that Victorians invoked between scientific photography and legal witnessing, but also on the impact of transformations in meteorology during the 1880s and 1890s on Victorian uses and perceptions of photographs as meteorological evidence" (Tucker, 384).
- "a rich confusion of observations of the color and forms of lightning" (Tucker, 387)
- "had been retouched? Did this worsen or improve the faithfulness of the representation?" (Tucker, 388)
- "Were unexpected results of lightening photography evidence of nature, artifacts of technology, or the result of human nature?" (Tucker, 388).
- "Scientific photography built on the notion of objectivity, but neither atlases nor photographs escape judgment" (Tucker, 394).
- "The possibility that photography could record psychic or spiritual forces seemed to some Victorians no more marvelous than other scientific discoveries made with photographic processes in the fields of astronomy, meteorology, physics, and biology" (Tucker, 397).
- "like photographic practices in meteorology and bacteriology, spirit photography highlighted issues of witnessing, detecting, and deceiving" (Tucker, 402).
- "during an era of widespread debate about the reality and agency of bacteria, visual representations of microbes made germs tangible"

Pre-notes:

- Photography as a witness
- Photography as a detective

Response:

Photography must act as a witness of experiments, observations, and anything you want to demonstrate. Tucker writes "We cannot claim to have really seen anything before having photographed it" (Tucker, 380). However, Tucker also adds that context in photographs is important; "a photographer must 'prove his photograph' by expounding the manner in which it had been made before the image could be admitted as a matter of fact" (Tucker, 379). Context, a theory, or proof is important along with a photograph as photographs can be vague or deceiving. Tucker also comments on the importance of photography as they progressed into the nineteenth century; Tucker writes "scholars have detailed the nineteenth century's belief in the power of photographic technology to replicate the act of unmediated seeing, to eliminate human prejudice and to minimize the errors that allegedly vitiated the objectivity of drawings" (Tucker, 380). Slowly photography proved its use as being a witness, and its power to demonstrate observations.

Tucker also writes about the confusion, panic, or concerns that overuse of photography causes. She talks about spirit photography, and the photographs that are taken by individuals looking for spirits. She writes "like photographic practices in meteorology and bacteriology, spirit photography highlighted issues of witnessing, detecting, and deceiving" (Tucker, 402). Spirit photography demonstrates flaws in using photography to witness and learn from photographs as sometimes it can provide incorrect results because of the use of trick photography.
