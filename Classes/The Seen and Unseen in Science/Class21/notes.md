- Daston and Galison, Objectivity 11-34, 42-49, 55-68, 115-138

Abstract:

Daston and Galison's Objectivity is a deeply qualitative evaluation of the methods of the quantitative sciences and what it means to do science. By mapping the historical trajectory of objectivity through the examination of three epistemological values:

    - truth to nature
    - mechanical objectivity
    - trained judgment

Throughout the book, it is Daston and Galison's primary objective to document how artifacts of science are qualified through their placement at varying distances critical and physical to the producer of scientific facts.

Objectivity has a history, and it is full of surprises. In Objectivity, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison chart the emergence of objectivity in the mid-nineteenth-century sciences--and show how the concept differs from its alternatives, truth-to-nature and trained judgment. This is a story of lofty epistemic ideals fused with workaday practices in the making of scientific images.

From the eighteenth through the early twenty-first centuries, the images that reveal the deepest commitments of the empirical sciences--from anatomy to crystallography--are those featured in scientific atlases, the compendia that teach practitioners what is worth looking at and how to look at it. Galison and Daston use atlas images to uncover a hidden history of scientific objectivity and its rivals.

Whether an atlas maker idealizes an image to capture the essentials in the name of truth-to-nature or refuses to erase even the most incidental detail in the name of objectivity or highlights patterns in the name of trained judgment is a decision enforced by an ethos as well as by an epistemology. As Daston and Galison argue, atlases shape the subjects as well as the objects of science. To pursue objectivity--or truth-to-nature or trained judgment--is simultaneously to cultivate a distinctive scientific self wherein knowing and knower converge. Moreover, the very point at which they visibly converge is in the very act of seeing not as a separate individual but as a member of a particular scientific community. Embedded in the atlas image, therefore, are the traces of consequential choices about knowledge, persona, and collective sight. Objectivity is a book addressed to anyone interested in the elusive and crucial notion of objectivity-- and in what it means to peer into the world scientifically.

Background

Lorraine Daston is Director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in
Berlin, Germany. She is the coauthor of Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150-1750 and the editor of Things That Talk: Object Lessons from Art and Science (both Zone Books).

Peter Galison is Pellegrino University Professor of the History of Science and of Physics at Harvard University.He is the author of Einstein's Clocks, Poincar's Maps: Empires of Time, How Experiments End, and Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics, and other books, and co-editor (with Emily Thompson) of The Architecture of Science (MIT Press, 1999).

Pre-notes:

Objectivity, in the sense of removing the inherent error in human subjectivity and observation from the process of scientific judgement, has not always been a part of the way the scientific community approaches data.

Response:

Daston and Galison explain the difficulty in being objective since objectivity could mean many different things to different people, and it is hard to universally define it. It is difficult to be objective about being objective. They explore the historical understanding and approaches to "objectivity" of scientific community by exploring the alternatives trained judgment, truth to nature, and mechanical judgment (all of which we have explored in class!).

They differentiate the three alternatives to the concept of objectivity in a clear way. An image produced by trained judgment is the "output of sophisticated equipment with a subjective smoothing of data the authors deemed the intervention necessary to remove instrumental artifacts" (Daston, 21), an image produced by mechanical objectivity "[attempts] to capture nature with as little human intervention as possible" (Daston, 20), and an image following the truth to nature "is an image of the characteristic, the essential, the universal, the typical" (Daston, 20). For me they represented different theoretical frameworks as different people can view scientific objectivity as a combination of the three alternatives. As we've seen in class there have been shifts in the methods that the community views as being objective, which usually have shifted between the three alternatives they present. I think they did a pretty great job showing the shifts that have happened, and how technology has altered how a scientist sees/observes and measures.

    - Meaning shifted because of Kant.

    - Moral virtue.
- Objectivity is something that people do - like honesty.

- Emotional aspect.
- I see objectivity in the same way as Wikipedia exists. A general consensus and agreement on what things are. Anyone is able to go and add or remove from that common knowledge that we have.
