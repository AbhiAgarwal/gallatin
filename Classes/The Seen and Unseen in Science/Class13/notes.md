Reading Persuasive pictures:

- Myers, "Illustrations in sociobiology"

Quotes:

- "Holton (1978) asserted that the lack of such a master image could limit the theory's popular appeal" (Myers, 236).
    - Images like the double helix or the Bohr atom.
- "We only become aware of our processes of interpretation with photographs when we are looking for some trick in them" (Myers, 242).
- "If realism is important, the best choices may well be photographs. Otherwise, diagrams, which allow you to emphasize certain features and eliminate the rest, are often the best medium" (Myers, 244).

Pre-notes:

- Most of these mediums allow us to create an abstraction. 

Response:

Maps represent a subset of what photographs represent, but are in most cases more powerful at depicting certain things. Myers writes "maps (of places or of bodies) are read as symbolic representations, rather than images of the observed world" (Myers, 239). This is something that we talked about in class and has stuck with me. In biology class it would have been extremely difficult to observe the flow of blood through photographs, but by creating a map of it and using arrows alongside the map it became easier for everyone to follow. Myers writes "in maps, the object is recognized as a space in two dimensions, and processes and entities can be marked as lines or arrows and regions within this grid" (Myers, 247). In addition, maps are also becoming incredibly powerful through technology, and nowadays maps, photographs, and drawings are all integrated together to cleverly and clearly depict the topic in question.

Drawings are necessary, in research, if photographs can not depict or are possible to use for what you're trying to show. For example, Galileo did drawings of everything he saw because could not photograph it. After this reading I believe it is necessary and possible to either draw or photograph at least the key points in your research. 

Models, graphs, or tables are very important in understanding data about a large population or a large sample. Photographs/drawings/maps are not always able to portray the consensus, opinions, etc. of a large number of people (Sometimes they are - comics/cartoons). In these mediums you have as much freedom to get across your point as you do in photography/maps/drawings. Nowadays it's incredibly easy to utilize data, and software to create drawings/models/graphs very easily. So there's no real downside to use them to explain your work.

Lastly, I believe that something is missing in these categories. Nowadays we utilize a lot of visual and interactive work to explain theories. For example, you're able to see 1000s of scientific papers in action when you go to google.com. I am not certain where this fits in, but it definitely, to me, fits into the same category. It's probably missing because it's the newest medium.
