% Side A: Professor Farnsworth?s discovery of the giant ball of garbage is reliable, the city is doomed, and we should begin looting immediately.
% Side B: Professor Farnsworth?s discovery of the giant ball of garbage is not reliable, the city has nothing to fear, and looting should be postponed slightly. 

%% ASSUMPTIONS
% 1000 years into the future

% Establish who this person is first.
% Talk about his personality

\par Professor Farnsworth has had many successes in the past. In the show, he has managed to create a clone of himself, the planet express ship (that runs at 300\% fuel capacity), invent a Paradox-Free Time Travel machine, is a tenured professor at the Mars University, and won a Fields Medal. In addition, he has also managed to save the world through his inventions in many ways in many different episodes. All of his inventions seem to have been impossible and beyond the realm of what was imaginable before they were invented. His experiences of building and changing the world in the past help validate the idea that it's possible that he managed to build a Smell-O-Scope.

\par However, just by his appearance in the clip (and previous knowledge) the professor doesn't seem like he's in the right mind. The professor forgot that he built the device a whole year ago, and is known to suffer from dementia. Naturally, it would be fairly difficult to trust a scientific breakthrough of that caliber if the individual was of that age and medical condition.

% There were multiple people who were smelling at least "something different" every time they smelled it.
% Personality of the people around him

\par It's also useful to take into account the other people who tried out his discovery. Both Fry and Leela tried out the Smell-O-Scope. Leela's personality is often skeptical and logical, and this suggests that if she believed in the professor's discovery then the audience would be equally as likely to believe in his discovery. In addition, just by the speed Fry, Leela, and Bender run towards him suggests that they are usually excited to see his discoveries.

%% The extra scientific device they use.

\par Moreover, the fact that they used a computer and can map the trajectory of the giant ball of garbage does help validate the idea that the Smell-O-Scope is a reliable device. They used computational methods to validate their hypothesis, using satellites and other scientific radars, to guarantee that there is a moving object in space and it's coming towards either (regardless of its smell and what it's composed of). 

% Go into scientific understanding of what can be done and what can't be done.

\par The Smell-O-Scope has only been tested once. Since they are able to go into space, they could have validated their smells for other planets and see if they match, but haven't. To this point we haven't seen the `golden event', which Galison defines as ``the single picture of such clarity and distinctness that it commands acceptance" (Galison, 360), or any statistical evidence where we have valid evidence that the Smell-O-Scope works.

\par If it hasn't been and done before it doesn't mean it can't happen. A lot of the disbelief in an invention comes from the ideology that if something hasn't been done before it's extremely likely that it is going to be possible now. There hasn't been a way to smell things from long distances, and the professor's discovery allows for this. Hooke's use of microscopes for scientific observations made "the world was not what it seemed. [His observations] documented that (1) many 'invisible' things actually existed, and that (2) seeing objects microscopically disclosed radically new appearances" (Hardwood, 136). 

\par Cohen would argue that 
par "Thus an explorer going into a new land tends to "see" what he expected to find, filling his reports with comparisons made between the new land and the lands with which the explorer was already familiar, either from personal experience or from reading and conversations" (Cohen, 459). 

\par Smell is a sense, and it can be extended. Just like you can see things far using a telescope or close through a microscope - you might be able to smell things from far as well. We've been able to extend our hearing, and seeing - why not also smelling?
\par "Science no longer depended on the primary sense-impressions of sight, feel, sound, taste, or smell, but rather on the output of a scientific instrument that became a mediator of the direct impressions of nature" (Cohen, 434).

\par In conclusion,
