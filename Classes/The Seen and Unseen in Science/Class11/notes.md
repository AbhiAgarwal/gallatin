Reading Dark Matter:

- Marcia Bartusiak, Through a Universe Darkly

Quotes:

- "Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212).
- "An entirely new picture of a spiral galaxy emerged from their work" (Bartusiak, 213).
- "Nature has played a trick on astronomers, for we thought we were studying the universe," says Rubin. "We now know that we were studying only the small fraction of it that is luminous" (Bartusiak, 216).
- "Theories contend that the dark matter is actually a hundred times more plentiful than the luminous stars and galaxies" (Bartusiak, 216).
- "With over 90 percent of the matter in the universe still to play with, even the sky will not be the limit" (Bartusiak, 218).
- "I think it's naive, though, to expect the dark-matter problem to have just one solution" said Carr. (Bartusiak, 236).

Response:

Something I realized while reading this extract, and have been told over and over again, was that truths, even in Physics, might not always you the entire picture. No matter how knowledgeable you are about the field. Bartusiak writes, "Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212), and "we were studying only the small fraction of it that is luminous" (Bartusiak, 216). Making this observation must have been paradigm-shifting for their research group as they realize that 90 percent of the universe had not been observed by us yet. It's hopeful, exciting, and scary that someone with an academic background like Vera Rubin, and with advisors like Feynman and Bethe, can say "[nature] has played a trick on astronomers, for we thought we were studying the universe" (Bartusiak, 216) and mean it. It implies that we still have a lot to explore, but it's also scary as not even the most well educated group of individuals will ever understand the complete picture.

The problem with detecting dark matter is that it neither absorbs or emits light. Therefore, the only way, in the past, to prove its existence was to look at how it effects normal matter. These are only indirect observations. I'm not too sure about the current research or any direct ways to observe dark matter - I'm also curious about the methods they use now in comparison to the 20th century in observing dark matter.
