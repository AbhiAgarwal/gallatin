Section: How a scientist sees. Reading Gender:

- Lisa Cartwright, Screening the body

Abstract:

Traces the fascinating history of scientific film during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and shows that early experiments with cinema are important precedents of contemporary medical techniques such as ultrasound. Lisa Cartwright brings to light eccentric projects in the history of science and medicine, such as Thomas Edison's sensational attempt to image the brain with X rays before a public audience, and the efforts of doctors to use the motion picture camera to capture movements of the body, from the virtually imperceptible flow of blood to epileptic seizures.

Response:

To be honest, I was kind of shocked after reading this work. This is something I'm not too familiar with, but these two quotes really shocked me: "[these] films also identify the female body as a key vector of TB contagion. Carelessly infecting lovers, family, and community, the tubercular woman featured in many of the TB public health films of this period as an insidious treat to the public" (147), and "[she] is dangerous not simply because she suffers from TB, but because she may spread the infectious disease without exhibiting its sign and symptoms" (147). It's a little difficult for me to place myself in a theoretical framework that would allow me to imagine this is a good way to advertise TB contagion. It seems purely negative for everyone, and the explanation provided didn't help.

I think most of what I understood from this reading can be summarized on page 170 where Cartwright writes "[the] point, then, is not that images constitute privileged medical knowledge and power over those imaged and therefore women should resist being imaged; rather women must actively reconfigure technologies of representation-precisely because these technologies have been invested with the power to transform the body physically" (170). I think she did a great job talking about the historical aspect of women and the public culture of radiography, but I found it hard to relate to the topic: "How a scientist sees". I think most of her work was more societal and how society sees and molds scientific techniques. The male, perhaps, misusing these techniques or perceived to be misusing these techniques to his advantage rather than for the treatment. It may be to promote the idea that science does good with or without public perception, and it is the job of scientists and researchers to promote public image to help solve issues like TB?
