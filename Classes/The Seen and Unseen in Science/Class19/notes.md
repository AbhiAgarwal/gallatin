- Kuhn, Structure of scientific revolutions

Abstract:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is a 1962 book about the history of science by philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of scientific knowledge and triggered an ongoing worldwide assessment and reaction in—and beyond—those scholarly communities. Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in "normal science." Normal scientific progress was viewed as "development-by-accumulation" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of such conceptual continuity in normal science were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of "anomalies" during revolutions in science leads to new paradigms. New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere "puzzle-solving" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the "map" directing new research.

Overview

- "Normal scientific progress was viewed as "development-by-accumulation" of accepted facts and theories"
- "Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of such conceptual continuity in normal science were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science"
- "The discovery of "anomalies" during revolutions in science leads to new paradigms. New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere "puzzle-solving" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the "map" directing new research"
- "Kuhn's insistence that a paradigm shift was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work"
- "For some commentators it introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements"

Approach

- Kuhn's approach to the history and philosophy of science focuses on conceptual issues like the practice of Normal Science:
    - influence of historical events
    - emergence of scientific discoveries
    - nature of scientific revolutions
    - progress through scientific revolutions
- Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities.
- Such an approach is largely commensurate with the general historical school of non-linear history.
- Copernicus, Newton, Lavoisier, and Einstein. 

Examples from Chemistry

Kuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the history of science. For instance, at a particular stage in the history of chemistry, some chemists began to explore the idea of atomism. Many substances, when heated, have a tendency to decompose into their constituent elements, and often (though not invariably) these elements can be observed to combine only in set proportions. At one time, a combination of water and alcohol was generally classified as a compound. Nowadays it is considered to be a solution, but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, nor will they separate upon distillation (they form an azeotrope). Water and alcohol can be combined in any proportion.

Quotes:

- "Perhaps science does not develop by the accumulation of individual discoveries and inventions"
- "Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like" (5).
- "Normal science means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice" (10).
- "Comtemplating a falling stone, Aristotle saw a change of state rather than a process" (124).

Response:

I enjoyed his idea about the phases Science goes through from the the pre-paradigm phase to the "Normal Science" phase to scientific revolution to post-revolution. I had a problem with the idea of moving between these phases. To me, it seems difficult to realize which phase you're in, but it seems obvious when looking at his theory and the historical evidence he presents. It's difficult since most of the work that your peers/researchers are doing could always revolutionary, but not does not necessarily mean it leads to a paradigm shift or lead to a period of crisis. Is this a framework to help us frame our future or just look back? I assume it's the latter, but I am finding it difficulty to grasp the potential of the paradigm idea and its relation to the future. Maybe there is no relation.

In addition, the scientific revolution phase or his "crisis" phase also seems interesting. In these phases scientists go out and question their assumptions; Khun writes "perhaps science does not develop by the accumulation of individual discoveries and inventions" (Khun, 1). He differentiates these phases from his "Normal Science" phase where "the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like" (5), and Khun adds "Normal science means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice" (10).
