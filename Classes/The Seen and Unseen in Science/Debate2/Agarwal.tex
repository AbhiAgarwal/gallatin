\noindent \textbf{Side A}: Obi-wan: The Force is an energy field generated by all living things, it surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.

\par In `Star Wars: A New Hope', Obi-wan (or other characters) continually sense disturbances in the force when catastrophic events happen, and these feelings always end up being valid. When living things die, there is a change in the force and to Obi-wan and the Force-sensitives, this change evokes some kind of feeling or emotion. This implies that there must be some power that allows them to feel changes in life even across galaxies.

\par Han not having observed or experienced the force does not imply that it does not exist. Bartusiak, in her book `Through a Universe Darkly', wrote ``Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212). Experiencing the force is not necessary; simply an observation is enough. Rubin did not directly feel or experience the `extra material', but she observed it. She observed it through a medium, the rotation of a galaxy, and in the same way an individual is able to observe the force through a source. The individual can overlook while a member of the Jedi Order is using the physical power of the force. Han lacks this observation, and it is valid for him to believe that the force does not exist simply because he has never encountered it in his past.

\par In addition, 

\par ``he could measure nothing except by chance collisions of movements imperceptible to his senses, perhaps even imperceptible to his instruments, but perceptible to each other, and so to some known ray at the end of the scale" (Adams, 2).

\par ``Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212).

\noindent \textbf{Side B}: Han Solo: There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.  It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.  I call it luck.
