\noindent \textbf{Side A}: Obi-wan: The Force is an energy field generated by all living things, it surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.

\par In `Star Wars: A New Hope', Obi-wan (and other characters) continually senses disturbances in the Force when catastrophic events happen, and these feelings always end up being valid. When living things die, there is a change in the Force and to Obi-wan and the Force-sensitives, this change evokes some kind of feeling or emotion. This implies that there must exist some power that allows them to feel changes in life even across galaxies. Obi-wan calls this energy the Force, and it is what allows the Jedi Order to protect `The Galaxy' from the Sith Order. Moreover, in the Star Wars universe there also exist Force Ghosts, who are deceased Force-sensitives who can still interact with the living. This solidifies the existence of the Force since it shows the true binding power of the Force (in this case to people who can control it). In addition, both the Jedi Order and the Sith Order gain from the existence of the Force so it reduces the motivation for either of the orders to falsely promote its existence to increase fear.

\par Han not having observed or experienced the Force does not imply that it does not exist. Bartusiak, in her book `Through a Universe Darkly', wrote ``Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212). Rubin, through her research, showed that there was matter that was invisible, contained mass, and contained enough mass to alter and shape the universe live in. Dark matter, in a way, binds our galaxies together. In a similar way, the Force binds `The Galaxy' together. The Force described does not have to consist of matter or be an energy in the traditional sense, but can be an energy that binds life forms together in some other metaphysical way. The closest representation of Force to traditional forces would be to observe changes in entropy. In the Star Wars universe, Force was discovered then used to keep order in `The Galaxy'. Bartusiak writes ``We now know that we were studying only the small fraction of it that is luminous" (Bartusiak, 216). Han only sees the luminous while Obi-wan sees beyond just the luminous.

\par Experiencing the Force, by being a Force-sensitive, is not necessary; simply an observation is enough to realize its existence. Rubin did not directly feel or experience the `extra material', but she observed it. She observed it through a medium, in this case the rotation of a galaxy, and in the same way an individual is able to observe the Force through a source. The individual can overlook while a member of the Jedi Order is using the physical power of the Force against an opponent. Han lacks this observation, and it is valid for him to believe that the Force does not exist simply because he has never encountered it in his past. In addition, it is plausible for Han to have never observed the force since the number of Force-sensitive beings is very low, and people are able to go through their lives without ever seeing one. But, his lack of observation should not determine the existence of the Force.

\par Planck described this as a question in his essay `Unity of the physical world-picture'. Planck writes ``[the] constant element, independent of every human (and indeed of every intellectual) individuality, is what we call `the Real'. Or is there today a single physicist worthy of serious consideration who doubts the reality of the energy principle?" (Planck, 25). In this case, the `Real' is the Force, the physicist is the non-believer, and the principle is a field made up of living things. 

\par The existence of the Force is necessary and powerful in the Star Wars universe. It binds the galaxies together, and keeps the good and bad in the universe constant. 

\newpage 

\noindent \textbf{Side B}: Han Solo: There is no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.  It is all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I call it luck. 

\par From a statistical standpoint the number of people who have directly experienced, felt, or observed this mystical energy, or as they call it `the Force', is a very small percentage (as noted in `Star Wars: A New Hope'). This reduces the reliability of the existence of the Force and it increases doubt. It questions the existence of the Force, and suggests that it could be a trick played by a small group of people. In addition, like Skywalker, in order to learn to harness the power of the Force one needs to be trained; this training could be a training to learn the tricks behind this mystical energy field.

\par Mach

\par Creating a substance such as the Force could increase order and could be a way of understanding the universe.

\par ``The heuristic hypothesis has no existential significance, but is only suggestive of further experiments, of new observations or information in the articulation of a programme of inquiry. The heuristic hypothesis is merely a tool or an instrument" (Nye, 250).

\par ``What really matters is that we recognize such a fixed goal, even if it can never be quite this goal is not the complete adaptation of our ideas to our impressions, but the complete liberation of the physical world-picture from the individuality of the creative mind" (Planck, 26).
