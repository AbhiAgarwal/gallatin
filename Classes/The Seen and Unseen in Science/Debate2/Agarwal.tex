\noindent \textbf{Side A}: Obi-wan: The Force is an energy field generated by all living things, it surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.

\par In `Star Wars: A New Hope', Obi-wan (and other characters) continually senses disturbances in the Force when catastrophic events happen, and these feelings always end up being valid. When living things die, there is a change in the Force and to Obi-wan and the Force-sensitives, this change evokes some kind of feeling or emotion. This implies that there must exist some power that allows them to feel changes in life even across galaxies. Obi-wan calls this energy the Force, and it is what allows the Jedi Order to protect `The Galaxy' from the Sith Order. In addition, both the Jedi Order and the Sith Order gain from the existence of the Force so it reduces the motivation for either of the orders to falsely promote its existence to increase fear.

\par Han not having observed or experienced the Force does not imply that it does not exist. Bartusiak, in her book `Through a Universe Darkly', wrote ``Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212). Rubin, through her research, showed that there was matter that was invisible, contained mass, and contained enough mass to alter and shape the universe live in. Dark matter, in a way, binds our galaxies together. In a similar way, the Force binds `The Galaxy' together. The Force described does not have to be an energy in the traditional sense, but can be an energy that binds life forms together in some other metaphysical way.

% It's not matter. It's another type of energy. But the idea still stands. The concept still stands. It doesn't bind the galaxy together in terms of gravitational energy, but it binds it through life forms and good and bad energy. Allows people to keep the galaxy safe.

\par Experiencing the Force, by being a Force-sensitive, is not necessary; simply an observation is enough to realize its existence. Rubin did not directly feel or experience the `extra material', but she observed it. She observed it through a medium, in this case the rotation of a galaxy, and in the same way an individual is able to observe the Force through a source. The individual can overlook while a member of the Jedi Order is using the physical power of the Force against an opponent. Han lacks this observation, and it is valid for him to believe that the Force does not exist simply because he has never encountered it in his past. But, his lack of observation should not determine the existence of the Force. In addition, it is plausible for Han to have never observed the force since the number of Force-sensitive beings is very low, and people are able to go through their lives without ever seeing one. 

\par Freud. what we see is only the surface and there exists a vast abyss within us or above us which we may never truly be able to see or explain. more to a galaxy than meets the eye

\par ``he could measure nothing except by chance collisions of movements imperceptible to his senses, perhaps even imperceptible to his instruments, but perceptible to each other, and so to some known ray at the end of the scale" (Adams, 2).

\noindent \textbf{Side B}: Han Solo: There is no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.  It is all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I call it luck. 

\par From a statistical standpoint the number of people who have directly experienced, felt, or observed the Force is a very small percentage. This reduces the reliability of the Force and it increases doubt. It is a trick played by a small group of people. In order to learn to harness the power of the Force you need to be trained; this training could be a training to learn the tricks behind the Force. In addition,

\par Creating a substance such as the Force could increase order and could be a way of understanding the universe.
