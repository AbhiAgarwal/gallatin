%\par ``No system of physical measurement exists from which all knowledge based on induction is eliminated; this is true even of direct weighing. A single glance into a precision laboratory shows us how many experiences and abstractions are comprised in one such measurement, simple as it may appear" (Planck, 24).

- Ernst Mach (Class 6 - Atoms)
    - "We regard an object as being always present, whether or not it is sensible at the time. We are accustomed to regarding the object as existing unconditionally, although there is no such thing as unconditional existence" (Mach 42).
    - "there is no reality apart from our own impressions, and all natural science is in the last resort merely an economical adaptation of our thoughts to our impressions..." (Mach, 23)

- Max Planck (Class 6 - Atoms)
    - "Can we reasonably assert that the principle of energy conservation was valid in nature before any man was able to think about it, or that heavenly bodies will still move according to laws of gravity when our Earth, with all its inhabitants, has disintegrated?" (Planck, 23).
    - "...atoms, little as we know of their detailed properties, are no more and no less real than the heavenly bodies, or the earthly objects which surround us" (Planck, 24)

- Mary Jo Nye (Class 6 - Atoms)
    - "pure symbol of the act of abstraction" (Nye, 261).
    - "I rather expect that we shall some day find for what we now call atoms a mathematico-mechanical explanation which will render an account of atomic weight, of atomicity [valence], and of numerous other properties of the so-called atoms" (Nye, 256).

- Henry Adams (Class 7 - Electricity and magnetism)
    - "He had entered a supersensual world, in which he could measure nothing except by chance collisions of movements imperceptible to his senses, perhaps even imperceptible to his instruments, but perceptible to each other, and so to some known ray at the end of the scale. Langley seemed prepared for anything, even for an indeterminable number of universes interfused,â€”physics stark mad in metaphysics" (Adams, 2).
    - "All the rest had used sex for sentiment, never for force; to them, Eve was a tender flower, and Herodias an unfeminine horror. American art, like the American language and American education, was as far as possible sexless" (Adams, 4).
    - "[Adams] cared nothing for the sex of the dynamo until he could measure its energy" (11).
    - "To [the scholar], the dynamo itself was but an ingenious channel for conveying somewhere the heat latent in a few tons of poor coal hidden in a dirty engine-house carefully kept out of sight; but to Adams the dynamo became a symbol of infinity. As he grew accustomed to the great gallery of machines, he began to feel the forty-foot dynamos as a moral force, much as the early Christians felt the Cross" (Adams, 2).

- Tyndall (Class 8 - Imaginary things)
    - "Assuming this preparation on your part, the wish gradually grew within me to trace, and to enable you to trace, some of the more occult features and operations of Light and Colour" (2).
    - "I wished, if possible, to take you beyond the boundary of mere observation, into a region where things are intellectually discerned, and to show you there the hidden mechanism of optical action" (2).
    - "Breaking contact with the hampering details of earth, it associates him with a Power which gives fulness and tone to his existence, but which he can neither analyse nor comprehend" (19).
    - "Philosophers may be right in affirming that we cannot transcend experience: we can, at all events, carry it a long way from its origin. We can magnify, diminish, qualify, and combine experiences, so as to render them fit for purposes entirely new. In explaining sensible phenomena, we habitually form mental images of the ultra-sensible" (2).

- Stephen J. Gould (Class 9 - Intelligence)
    - ``How much better off we would be if all scientists submitted themselves to self-scrutiny in so forthright a fashion: `I want to state very explicitly,' Binet wrote (1900, p. 342), `what I have observed about myself. The details that follow are those that the majority of authors do not publish; one does not want to let them be known'" (Gould, 147).
    - ``In 1912 the German psychologist W. Stern argued that mental age should be divided by chronological age, not subtracted from it and the intelligence quotient, or IQ, was born" (Gould, 150).
    - ``True science progresses by induction from simple experiments pursued to gather basic facts, not to test elaborate theories" (Gould, 150).
    - ``Intelligence, Binet proclaimed, is too complex to capture with a single number. This number, later called IQ, is only a rough, empirical guide constructed for a limited, practical purpose" (Gould, 151).
    - "Not only did Binet decline to label IQ as inborn intelligence; he also refused to regard it as a general device for ranking pupils according to mental worth. he devised his scale only for the limited purpose of his commission by the ministry of education: as a practical guide for identifying children whose poor performance indicated a need for special education" (Gould, 152).
    - "Without denying the evidence fact that not all children, whatever their training, will enter the company of Newton and Einstein, they emphasize the power of creative education to increase the achievements of all children, often in extensive and unanticipated ways. Mental testing becomes a theory for enhancing potential through proper education" (Gould, 153).
    - "Alpha and Beta exams, the first mass-produced written tests of intelligence" (Gould, 195).
    - "Yerkes argued that men with more innate intelligence spend more time in school" (Gould, 218).
    - "The theory that native intelligence is one of the most important conditioning factors in continuance in school is certainly borne out by this accumulation of data" (Yerkes, 780).
    - "Yerkes found that average test scores for foreign-born recruits rose consistently with years of residence in America" (Gould, 220).

- Sigmund Freud (Class 10 - The unconscious)
    - "The first of these unpopular assertions made by psychoanalysis declares that mental processes are in themselves unconscious and that all mental life it is only certain individual acts and portions that are conscious" (Freud, 125).
    - "It may happen for instance that a person who intends to say something may use another word instead , or he may do the same thing in writing and may or may not notice what he has done" (Freud, 29).
    - "I wanted to show you our science as it is, with its unevennesses and roughnesses, its demands and hesitations. For I know that it is the same in all sciences and cannot possibly be otherwise" (Freud, 125).
    - "[the] conception of dream-elements tells us that they are ungenuine things, substitutes for something else that is unknown to the dreamer (like the purpose of a parapraxis), and substitutes for something like knowledge of which is present in the dreamer but which is inaccessible to him" (Freud, 138).
    - "No, this idea is too disagreeable; I will not or cannot report it" (Freud, 140).
    - "It is as though these patients had not finished the traumatic situation, as though they were still faced by it as an immediate task which has not been dealt with" (Freud, 340).
    - "If you consider this, you will understand that in psycho-analysis we cannot do without what is at the same time unconscious and mental, and are accustomed to operate with it as though it were something palpable to the senses" (Freud, 345).
    - "An increase of stimulus too powerful to be dealt with or worked off in the normal way" (Freud, 340).
    - "I wanted to show you our science as it is with its unevenness and roughness, its demands and hesitations. For I know that it is the same in all sciences and cannot possibly be otherwise, especially in their beginnings".
    - "Subject to the premiss that dreams are psychical phenomena, and subject to the further premiss that there are mental things in a man which he knows without knowing that he knows them..."
    - "Bringing to consciousness the unconscious processes which contained the sense of the symptoms".
    - "each individual who makes a fresh entry into human society repeats this sacrifice of instinctual satisfaction for the benefit of the whole community".
    - unevenness and roughness...demands and hesitations."

- Marcia Bartusiak (Class 11 - Dark Matter)
    - "Rubin realized that a huge reservoir of extra material, invisible to her telescope, must be tucked away somewhere to keep the stars from flying out of the galaxy" (Bartusiak, 212).
    - "An entirely new picture of a spiral galaxy emerged from their work" (Bartusiak, 213).
    - "Nature has played a trick on astronomers, for we thought we were studying the universe," says Rubin. "We now know that we were studying only the small fraction of it that is luminous" (Bartusiak, 216).
    - "Theories contend that the dark matter is actually a hundred times more plentiful than the luminous stars and galaxies" (Bartusiak, 216).
    - "With over 90 percent of the matter in the universe still to play with, even the sky will not be the limit" (Bartusiak, 218).
    - "I think it's naive, though, to expect the dark-matter problem to have just one solution" said Carr. (Bartusiak, 236).
