- Side A: Professor Farnsworth’s discovery of the giant ball of garbage is reliable, the city is doomed, and we should begin looting immediately.

Farnsworth is Correct

1. Farnsworth has had many successes in the past. 
    - He has managed to: Make a clone of himself, Invent a Paradox-Free Time Travel machine, Invented the F-Ray, Invented the part of robotics that gives it free-will, The Planet Express ship that they use, and much much more. He also designed the system for all the robots in the 31st century.
    - He's also managed to self the world through his inventions in many ways.
    - He's also a tenured professor at the Mars University. Teaches "Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields".
    - He's won a Fields Medal.
    - His [creations](http://theinfosphere.org/Category:Farnsworth%27s_creations).
    - Previous validations usually helps you trust a person in the future.

2. If it hasn't been done before it doesn't mean that it can't happen. 

3. Smell is a sense, and it can be extended. Just like you can see things far using a telescope or close through a microscope - you might be able to smell things from far as well.

- Side B: Professor Farnsworth’s discovery of the giant ball of garbage is not reliable, the city has nothing to fear, and looting should be postponed slightly. 

Farnsworth is Jumping the Gun

1. Doesn't seem like he's in the right mind. Since forgot that he built such a device a whole year ago.
    - If he thought about the idea twice it could mean that he's on to something. Since he thought about the fact that it can be designed twice (on separate occasions). And managed to think about the fact that it could work twice.
