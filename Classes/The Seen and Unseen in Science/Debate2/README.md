## Debate paper

- Side A: Obi-wan: The Force is an energy field generated by all living things, it surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.

1. If you can't feel it it's still a possibility it exists.
    - Obi-Wan: "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened", and it is true.
    - Darth Vader: "The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force."
2. If we can't see it or observe it doesn't mean that we won't be able to someday. (Dark matter).
3. Force is something you have to feel. You have to be force-sensitive. Perhaps none of us has felt it in the past. One of us has to be trained to feel that it exists.
    - "that atoms, as little as we know of their detailed properties, are no more and no less real than the heavenly bodies, or the earthly objects which surround us" (24).
4. You've never seen it in action. Possible to have two different results.
    - "fellow physicists, after conducting the same experiment quite independently, claimed to have reached opposite conclusions--as does sometimes happen--then he would be committing an error of principle if he inferred that at least one of them must be mistaken" (Planck, 24)
5. Very small number of Jedi's that exist. Extremely possible he's just never encountered one. Given there are 100s of quadrillion beings in the galaxy, and not many Jedi's.
    - Not many people have a reason to fight with the Jedi's.
    - Possible he's not interpreting the force correctly.
        - Han thinks they are a "religion" in Clone Wars.

- Side B: Han Solo: There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.  It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.  I call it luck. 

1. Percentage of people believing it's real is much lower. Just a select group of people trained to us it. Very high chance it's fake.
2. Mind trick like hypothesis?
    - There's a very small percentage of people claiming that it's valid.
3. Doesn't seem like there's a way to measure it or any way to quantify it. If there is a physical power to it there must be a way to measure it.
4. Cannot be seen. Unnecessary? Mach
