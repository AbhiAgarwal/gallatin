Reading The unconscious:

- Sigmund Freud, "Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis"

Quotes:

Pre-notes:

- Basic tenets of psychoanalysis:
    1. A person's development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone.
    2. Human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious.
    3. It is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness.
    4. Conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example:
        - Neurosis
        - Neurotic traits
        - Anxiety
        - Depression
    5. Liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).
- Specific type of treatment in which the analysand (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient's symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems.
- Freud theorized that dreams had symbolic significance, and generally were specific to the dreamer.

Response:

I connected Freud's writing to the discussion we had to intelligence in class a lot. It's simple to isolate intelligence and the characteristics that are grouped with it to define and measure them, but Freud's reading has shown me how much the subconscious influences thoughts. Parapraxis and dreams represent our unconscious and past mind. Freud writes "[the] conception of dream-elements tells us that they are ungenuine things, substitutes for something else that is unknown to the dreamer (like the purpose of a parapraxis), and substitutes for something like knowledge of which is present in the dreamer but which is inaccessible to him" (Freud, 138). In addition, there's also a continuation of the traumatic experience that shapes the way you reason: "It is as though these patients had not finished the traumatic situation, as though they were still faced by it as an immediate task which has not been dealt with" (Freud, 340). Freud also adds that there is always a specific motivation that guides and furthers these repeated unconscious thoughts. These ideas imply that there's a lot of things that impairs our intelligence. Is the unconscious a part of our intelligence? Or is it something that can be isolated from intelligence?

Moreover, the concept ego plays a very interesting role in Freud's work. From what I understand, it initially causes the patient to avoid and suppress memories. Then develops the ideal-self, which further suppresses these memories into the unconscious (from the realization of ideal-self vs self). In a later stage ego becomes something that blocks you from realizing the influence of your unconscious mind.

I, personally, can see how these things are plausible to be believed. Firstly, his examples are extremely polished and cherry picked for the points he wants to stress. His writing or lectures seem very inviting to questions and observations, and he also brings up personal stories that invite you into his personal life.

Learnings:

Class:

- Alien hypothesis: purely mental construction. If you had typhoid fever.
- Dreams:
    1. Communicate with you
    2. Wish fulfillment
    3. Bad dreams -> Your mind is just trying to go against Freudian theory.
    4. Society doesn't want you to express your opinions. We have moral and intellectual pressures. We can't talk about these socially so these issues come out in your subconscious.
    5. Trauma is hard to deal with with a conscious mind so your subconscious has to deal with it.
        - Useful for War trauma.
- Software vs Hardware analogy. Software is what things you think about in your brain, and hardware is your brain. Neurosurgeons look at hardware, and psychoanalysis look at software.
- Freud would rather talk to people rather than use medical reasons to fix a problem. Example: when you have a broken arm.
- Cold reading: Cold reading is a set of techniques used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, mediums and illusionists to imply that the reader knows much more about the person than the reader actually does.
