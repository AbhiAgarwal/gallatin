Reading Contesting representations:

- Maria Lane, "Geographies of Mars"

Quotes:

- "Maps solidified the idea that Mars was like Earth, induced nationalistic competitions among astronomers, and authorized a view of the Martian landscape as modified and possibly inhabited" (Lane, 25).
- "Where Green had used subtle naturalistic shading to represent an orange surface mottled with barely perceptible 'delicate markings,' Schiaparelli had used hard-edged black lines to show a detailed landscape of white islands divided by parallel and intersecting blue straits he labeled 'canali'" (Lane, 34).
- "despite Green's objections that Schiaparelli's artistry and coloration were flawed, his own map faced the impossible challenge of demonstrating more authority by presenting less detail" (Lane, 39).

This directly follows and contributes to the discussion we had on Monday. Through this readings I still felt like the early work done on creating maps of Mars were drawings, and that brings up the question - what constitutes a map? To discuss this, Lane discusses Proctor who "visually prioritized the Martian equatorial regions and deepened his implication that Mars was essentially mappable, navigable, and controllable in the same way that the imperial powers had come to see the equatorial regions of Earth" (Lane, 27). The idea, to me, that something should be visually prioritized in a map seems incorrect. This implies that maps are designed through someone's theoretical framework, and they usually visually prioritize what they think are the most important aspects of what's being mapped. If a drawing seems dishonest (in comparison to a photograph), then a map that is altered through someone's theoretical framework falls into the same bucket. Maps, in some aspects, are dishonest since they try and form structure on something that isn't structured in that way. This means that maps do require a theoretical framework to some degree.

I also mirror Lila's question: Why Mars? Depending on where the Earth, Mars, and Venus are in orbit - Venus is more frequently closer to the Earth than Mars is. Was Venus studied in as much depth or do people like the idea of being the red planet? Or was it that there wasn't any observable map that could have been drawn with these other planets?
