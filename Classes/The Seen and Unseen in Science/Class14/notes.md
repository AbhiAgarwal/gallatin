Reading Contesting representations:

- Maria Lane, "Geographies of Mars"

Quotes:

- "Maps solidified the idea that Mars was like Earth, induced nationalistic competitions among astronomers, and authorized a view of the Martian landscape as modified and possibly inhabited" (Lane, 25).
- "Where Green had used subtle naturalistic shading to represent an orange surface mottled with barely perceptible 'delicate markings,' Schiaparelli had used hard-edged black lines to show a detailed landscape of white islands divided by parallel and intersecting blue straits he labeled 'canali'" (Lane, 34).
- "despite Green's objections that Schiaparelli's artistry and coloration were flawed, his own map faced the impossible challenge of demonstrating more authority by presenting less detail" (Lane, 39).
