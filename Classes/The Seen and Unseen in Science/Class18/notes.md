- Group B: Dudley Shapere, "Concept of Observation in Science and Philosophy"

Abstract:

In this paper a new schema for the analysis of scientific observation is proposed. The concepts of `externality' and `evidential' context of observational reports are introduced. The degree of externality of reports is shown to be related to the specificity of the evidential context. Attention is drawn to how the new concepts differ from traditional issues raised by the problem of the theory-ladenness of observations. The analysis is illustrated by reference to the detection of solar neutrinos and measurements of solar oblateness. Detailed studies of these cases reveal how the externality and evidential context shifts during the course of observational disputes. Some of the consequences of the new schema for the analysis of scientific language, access to experimental data, and black-box instrumentation are developed.

Response:

I agree with Lila on it being a little tough to read, and hard to get a lot of learning-value out of this. That proves his point as he uses this to illustrate the theory-ladenness of observations. He uses measurements of solar oblateness, and a couple other theories to illustrate his point. The two big ideas that support or make up his theory are the ideas of externalities and evidence. He showcases these ideas to show the shift and provide a new form of scientific language (as well as other shifts). 

I understand the idea of using scientific terminology as it was created to express ideas and large concepts easily. If I was to talk to my friends I would utilize scientific or words that we use in our respected fields to describe processes or experiments we run. If I was to talk to my friends outside the field I would first explain to them the general idea of the experiment, and why each part is necessary. In a research paper, this becomes very tricky as one only has a limited space, and the target readers should already be fluent in their scientific terminology.

His theory expresses the idea that the externalities in a particular paper is related to how specific one must be in his/her evidence depending on the context. He writes, "a change to an observational report of lower externality might not raise any difficulties. For example, observational reports which refer to 'Ar37 atoms' and 'splodges on a graph' will still be valid: it is just that these cannot now be translated into reports on solar neutrinos. The chain of inference will have been broken" (Pinch, 16). There are some things that are easily translatable, but then more complex ideas that are built on top of a lot of small ideas are hard to express in a short number of words. That is why these scientific notations have been created.
