It was incredibly interesting to realize how much effort, and thought Darwin put into exploring and validating his theory. He spent 20 years thinking about the theory before publishing it, and dedicated his time to do careful drawings and think about all of the arguments against the theory. This was very interesting to observe since he formulated the theory very early on, but was waiting to gather proof so no one in the scientific community would be able to refute it. Voss writes: "Darwin made these notes while he lived in London and was in close contact with the city's scientific elite" (Voss, 65). He was in constant communication with the other Royal Society fellows, and other prominent scientists. In addition, I believe that Voss expresses Darwin's dedication and work towards his theory through this quote: "In the years that followed, Darwin completed his picture of evolution, and the sketches became a book illustration. Since 1837 he had tirelessly drawn new diagrams, filling page after page with a luxuriant growth of genealogies, branches, and origins. The sketches, showing the history of rodents or marsupials, became increasingly complex. Each hypothetical line was tested over the years with countless questions, the study of equally countless journals and books, experiments in his front yard, and statistical analysis" (Voss, 108).

It also seems like Darwin considered a very large number of applications for his theory, and attempted to explore every possible representation of these applications. Darwin was able to study the field of information representation incredibly thoroughly, and was able to make these beautiful diagrams using his statistical evidence. These visualizations definitely helped give an understanding of the theory since it showed the descent of man in the best possible way.
