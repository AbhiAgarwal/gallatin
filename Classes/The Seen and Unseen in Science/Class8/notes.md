Reading Imagination:

- John Tyndall, "Scientific use of the imagination"

Quotes:

- "Assuming this preparation on your part, the wish gradually grew within me to trace, and to enable you to trace, some of the more occult features and operations of Light and Colour" (2).
- "I wished, if possible, to take you beyond the boundary of mere observation, into a region where things are intellectually discerned, and to show you there the hidden mechanism of optical action" (2).
- "Breaking contact with the hampering details of earth, it associates him with a Power which gives fulness and tone to his existence, but which he can neither analyse nor comprehend" (19).
- "Philosophers may be right in affirming that we cannot transcend experience: we can, at all events, carry it a long way from its origin. We can magnify, diminish, qualify, and combine experiences, so as to render them fit for purposes entirely new. In explaining sensible phenomena, we habitually form mental images of the ultra-sensible" (2).

Response:

Tyndall's writing helped me figure out another piece of the puzzle we were trying to solve in class (the puzzle where we had the microscope, the brain, and the drawing). There needs to be an aspect of imagination to it. It seems that the brain needs to be split up - the rational side of the brain and the imaginative side of the brain. The rational side is the side that has previous images and sensations, and the imaginative side is the side that takes previous images and sensations and forms new ones. Tyndall writes "Philosophers may be right in affirming that we cannot transcend experience: we can, at all events, carry it a long way from its origin. We can magnify, diminish, qualify, and combine experiences, so as to render them fit for purposes entirely new. In explaining sensible phenomena, we habitually form mental images of the ultra-sensible" (Tyndall, 2). The combining of experiences is important as you're able to take certain past experiences and knowledge, and link it to things you learn in the present to make judgments and observations. This reminded me of Galileo's work. Galileo had past experiences in Art, and his perceived vision of the moon along with his imagination lead him to drawing craters on the moon. Tyndall also uses Darwin as an example to point this out, he writes: "In the case of Mr. Darwin, observation, imagination, and reason combined have run back with wonderful sagacity and success over a certain length of the line of biological succession" (Tyndall, 17).
