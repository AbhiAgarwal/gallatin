Reading Electromagnetism:

- Henry Adams, " The Dynamo and the Virgin"

Quotes:

- "He had entered a supersensual world, in which he could measure nothing except by chance collisions of movements imperceptible to his senses, perhaps even imperceptible to his instruments, but perceptible to each other, and so to some known ray at the end of the scale. Langley seemed prepared for anything, even for an indeterminable number of universes interfused,—physics stark mad in metaphysics" (Adams, 2).
- "All the rest had used sex for sentiment, never for force; to them, Eve was a tender flower, and Herodias an unfeminine horror. American art, like the American language and American education, was as far as possible sexless" (Adams, 4).
- "[Adams] cared nothing for the sex of the dynamo until he could measure its energy" (11).
- "To [the scholar], the dynamo itself was but an ingenious channel for conveying somewhere the heat latent in a few tons of poor coal hidden in a dirty engine-house carefully kept out of sight; but to Adams the dynamo became a symbol of infinity. As he grew accustomed to the great gallery of machines, he began to feel the forty-foot dynamos as a moral force, much as the early Christians felt the Cross" (Adams, 2).

Pre-notes:

- The idea of the woman (Virgin, or Goddess) was not considered a powerful force to Americans in the 1900s.
- Women were only mentioned in Peter Galison’s Image and Logic. 
    - Galison discussed the woman’s roll as particle analyzing "computers" in the subatomic field. Galison writes, "Even when physicists disagreed about how to configure the data analysis system, there was general agreement that there be a gendered division of labor in whatever process they supported" (Galison, 375).
- Adams’ piece was refreshingly empowering in its vision of woman; rather than woman being given benign tasks (which the chief male scientists did not want to do), Adams argues that women are a force to be reckoned with.
- Yet, their potential, like many of the things scientists were choosing to analyze at that time, were (seemingly) invisible to the public eye.
    - Woman in the US had to work to get their potentials recognized; men did not see how they would be helpful as anything other than computers (and housewives) until later in history.
- The focus on the Virgin and Venus as wasted entitites in the minds of educated Americans is not commonly spoken about. The American idealized version of sex created from pure images of the Virgin Eve pushed in the exact opposite direction of strength and force- which were two adjectives of high esteem in American education and society.
- Thus, women and sex became a sentiment, never valued as forceful or powerful, so they were ignored in the scientific and mathematical realms.
- Observing change. Traditional beliefs vs Progress

Response:

The dynamo represents the device that powered the industrial revolution. Adams is saying that the dynamo represents the progress that is being made, and opposes that to the Virgin, Venus, which represents traditional beliefs. Throughout this reading, I thought Adams was trying to observe change and comment on the two big areas of change: progress and traditional (or previous) values and beliefs.

Adam writes "to [the scholar], the dynamo itself was but an ingenious channel for conveying somewhere the heat latent in a few tons of poor coal hidden in a dirty engine-house carefully kept out of sight; but to Adams the dynamo became a symbol of infinity. As he grew accustomed to the great gallery of machines, he began to feel the forty-foot dynamos as a moral force, much as the early Christians felt the Cross" (Adams, 2), and "St. Gaudens at Amiens was hardly less sensitive to the force of the female energy than Matthew Arnold at the Grande Chartreuse. Neither of them felt Goddesses as power,—only as reflected emotion, human expression, beauty, purity, taste, scarcely even as sympathy. They felt a railway train as power, yet they, and all other artists, constantly complained that the power embodied in a railway train could never be embodied in art. All the steam in the world could not, like the Virgin, build Chartres" (Adams, 15). I believe he explains that neither the Virgin nor the dynamo are able to replace the characteristic and importance each of them bring.

Adams also comments on the Virgin or women not being powerful in America. He writes "[the] Woman had once been supreme; in France she still seemed potent, not merely as a sentiment, but as a force. Why was she unknown in America?" (Adams, 10). 

Adams avoids favoring either progress or traditional values. He aims to strictly comment on change, and the perception of things as change occurs. Moreover, I found this reading a little confusing. I am still uncertain if I completely understood the aim of this reading. I found it hard to relate it directly to things we have discussed in the past.

Questions:

- Do women get their own piece in our studies, as a sort-of “invisible,” or untapped, source of knowledge for scientists in the 1900s?
- Or have a completely misunderstood the readings, with the idea of the “woman” being a stand-in for another, more scientific term?

Class:

- Sublime: Feeling you have. When you look at the ocean. Glory of human God. If you see a miracle. Standing on top of the Mountain. Awe comes a long with sublime. Gasp feeling. Thinking about things that are bigger than yourself. Sense of perfection. Perfection you can just tap into.
- Electricity is just a tiny bit of the energy/power hidden within the universe.
