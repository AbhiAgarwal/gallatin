% Is there one trait intelligence boils down to?
% Should there be one trait? Should we be looking for that one trait?

\par Most of the history of the study of intelligence is dominated by psychologists. From Francis Galton to Alfred Binet to Cyril L. Burt to Howard Gardner. Most of the history we explore of intelligence testing, definitions of intelligence, or the measurement of intelligence has been attributed to psychologists. When solely studying it from a perspective of a psychologist, it provides limited exposure to aims and methodology that researchers in other fields have done to study intelligence. This paper explores how intelligence has been defined, measured, and the aim of defining intelligence from the perspective of individuals in different fields.

% Talk about historical foundations of: Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Juan Huarte, Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard, Charles Darwin (very important for some reason).

% Perhaps have a labeled diagram of the most influential intelligence thinkers and label them by their fields. I want to explore the intentions and measures of what other people in other fields talked about intelligence.

\par Charles Darwin's evolutionary theories are central to a lot of arguments presented in intelligence theories. Darwin's and Wallace's theories provided an argument to begin the nurture vs nature debate. Barlow, in her additions to `The Autobiography of Charles Darwin',  quotes Darwin as saying ``I do not think that I owe much to him intellectually-nor to my four sisters... I am inclined to agree with Francis Galton in believing that education and environment produce only a small effect on the mind of any one, and that most of our qualities are innate" (Barlow, 43).
Darwin was a naturalist.

\par Jeff Hawkins, a well known technologist, develops his theory, from the background of a Electrical Engineer turned Biophysicist turned self-taught Neuroscientist, in his book `On Intelligence'. Hawkins' aim to measure and quantify intelligence is to be able to re-build it in the form of an Artificially Intelligent agent. This is fundamentally different from the aims of many other researcher seeking to define and measure intelligence. The distinction is important since one seeks to explore or quantify intelligence for philosophical or experimentation purposes, and one seeks to go a step further and make attempts to build it. In addition, the theoretical framework or worldview of being able to build an intelligent machine only became possible after the formation of the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.

\par Hawkins' theory is solidified on the idea that intelligence is just learning to see repetitions in patterns, and does not constitute of the ability to do any specific tasks. Hawkins writes ``the intelligent machine must learn via observation of its world, including input from an instructor when necessary. Once our intelligent machine has created a model of its world, it can then see analogies to past experiences, make predictions of future events, propose solutions to new problems, and make this knowledge available to us" (Hawkins, 209). In addition, Hawkins is also highly influenced in his work by Mountcastle's research, and some of his theories are grounded in the correctness of Mountcastle's theories.

\par ``Intelligence is measured by the predictive ability of a hierarchical memory, not by humanlike behavior" (Hawkins 210). ``Intelligent machines will have the equivalent of a cortex and a set of senses, but the rest is optional" (Hawkins, 208).
