- Context: A meteorite has landed near a New Mexico town, and virtually all the inhabitants are dead from what seems to be an alien pathogen â€“ now known as the "Andromeda Strain". A group of scientists studying the pathogen using the most advanced technology available has recommended that an atomic bomb be dropped on the town. They continue to study the pathogen.
