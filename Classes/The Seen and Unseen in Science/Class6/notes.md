Quotes:

- "One does not often question the published parameters of an experimental apparatus, and to do so, one must have a very good reason" (Alvarez, 979).
- "At every level the traditions clashed: golden event versus statistical demonstration, the objectivity of passive registration versus the persuasiveness of experiment control, vision versus numbers, and photography versus electronics" (Galison, 363).
- "'golden event': the single picture of such clarity and distinctness that it commands acceptance" (Galison, 360).

Culturally, this reading shows how big the shift in the average scientific methodology was from Galileo to Galison. Alvarez, in "Analysis of a Reported Magnetic Monopole", writes "[one] does not often question the published parameters of an experimental apparatus, and to do so, one must have a very good reason" (Alvarez, 979). The shift was from people not utilizing scientific equipment in their everyday experimenting (during Galileo's time) to people not trusting and doubting their scientific equipment (during Hooke's time) to, now, people taking the results produced by their scientific equipment to be an assumed trustworthy source. In addition, for an individual who's very passionate about the use of scientific equipment, Alvarez, is cautious of automation of everything. He seeks a balance between relying on scientific equipment to find discoveries for you, and using scientific equipment to test hypotheses.

The other very interesting idea presented was the idea of the shift away from the golden event. A golden event as Galison described it was "the single picture of such clarity and distinctness that it commands acceptance" (Galison, 360). Galison describes the idea that we've been getting at in class - statistics in experimentation becomes fundamental at cognition level (the brain), and helps us perceive the world around us. Galison, when discussing scientific methodology, writes "[at] every level the traditions clashed: golden event versus statistical demonstration, the objectivity of passive registration versus the persuasiveness of experiment control, vision versus numbers, and photography versus electronics" (Galison, 363).
