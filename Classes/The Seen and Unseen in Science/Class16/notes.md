Reading Brain scans:

- Joe Dumit, "Picturing personhood"

Quotes:

- "PET images in popular culture raise questions of reference and representation - producing the world they are produced by and are part of ... seeing a multicolored blob as a brain image is a result of learning to see" (Dumit, 144).
- "Normal people are shown to share a characteristic that is different from those of depressed people. Reading the accompanying text reveals a heroic story of the technological quest to produce a beautiful and interpretable image of the brain in action, a question that is in the process of being fulfilled" (Dumit, 144).
- "The key part of brain imaging is that as the image becomes more simple and ionic, it also becomes more subjective (personally invested in) and universal (generalizable to human nature)" (Dumit, 147).
- "The medical imaging advantage was measured in two ways. First, it allowed correlation between brains and diagnosis among living humans, thus permitting anew the equation of brain=illness. Second, medical imaging promised to provide early warnings of the onset of mental illness, one of the largest problems in its treatment and prevention" (Dumit, 147).
- "New Seeing-Eye Machines ... look inside your body, can save your life" (161).

Pre-notes:

- PET (Positron emission tomography) scan

Response:

PET images have a large influence, "persuasive power and objective authority over human nature" (Dumit, 141). PET scans are the most powerful technique of taking a snapshot of any part of our body. The brain is one of the most complex parts of our body, and one of the parts that we understand the least. PET images hold an influence because, similar to other parts of the body, the images can now be used to tell if you have any type of mental problems. The problem is that we have to understand the brain much more in order to diagnose mental issues with certainty. Unlike any other part of the body or any other object we look at (stars, nature, etc.), one of the debates here is that we're using our brains to study images of the brain and then attempting to interpret them. Dumit writes, "PET images in popular culture raise questions of reference and representation - producing the world they are produced by and are part of ... seeing a multicolored blob as a brain image is a result of learning to see" (Dumit, 144). 

Dumit further reinforces the idea that in every scientific representation there will be some theoretical framework at play. Dumit writes, "the key part of brain imaging is that as the image becomes more simple and ionic, it also becomes more subjective (personally invested in) and universal (generalizable to human nature)" (Dumit, 147). Diagrams and representations are usually simplified for research papers and materials, which reduces how realistic they are and makes them more subjective.
