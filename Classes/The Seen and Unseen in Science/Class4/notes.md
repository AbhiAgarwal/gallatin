Reading Microscope:

- Robert Hooke, Micrographia
- John Harwood, "Rhetoric and graphics in Micrographia"

Quotes:

- "The only way which now remains for us to recover some degree of those former perfections, seems to be, by rectifying the operations of the Sense, the Memory, and Reason, since upon the evidence, the strength, the integrity, and the right correspondence of all these, all the light, by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed, and all our command over things it to be establisht" (Hooke, 2).
- "It is therefore most worthy of our consideration, to recollect their several defects, that so we may the better understand how to supply them, and by what assistances we may inlarge their power, and secure them in performing their particular duties" (Hooke, 2).
- "The truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made only a work of the Brain and the Fancy: It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of Observations on material and obvious things. It is said of great Empires, That the best way to preserve them from decay, is to bring them back to the first Principles, and Arts, on which they did begin. The same is undoubtedly true in Philosophy, that by wandring far away into invisible Notions, has almost quite destroy'd it self, and it can never be recovered, or continued, but by returning into the same sensible paths, in which it did at first proceed" (Hooke, 4).
- "I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with some Materials, which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill, and to far greater advantage." (Hooke, 4).
- "The world was not what it seemed. The plates documented that (1) many 'invisible' things actually existed, and that (2) seeing objects microscopically disclosed radically new appearances" (Hardwood, 136).

Pre-notes:

- In the preface to Micrographia, Hooke recognized that the human senses, that, despite our incredible intelligence, are imperfect and incapable of discerning much of the world around us.
- In observing and illustrating the microscopic world, Hooke acted as a scientific vessel, using his own hands (and those of his assistants) to recreate a universe known only to a handful of people alive in his era.
- But Hooke must have felt like a messenger from a world beyond, delivering a report on sights that he witnessed for perhaps the first time among humans.
- As he says in his preface, the microscope (and the telescope) allow us to discover completely new worlds, previously unimagined - and Micrographia does a great job of conveying Hookeâ€™s excitement and wonder as he voyaged into the unknown.

Response:

Hardwood, throughout his work, really manages to understand and explain the context and excitement behind what Hooke was trying to achieve and his goals around it. Throughout Hooke's work it was really clear to see that he knew he was exploring the unknown. Hooke clearly understood the discovery he had made as he observes that "[the] world was not what it seemed. The plates documented that (1) many 'invisible' things actually existed, and that (2) seeing objects microscopically disclosed radically new appearances" (Hardwood, 136). Throughout his book he manages to keep the reader involved as he makes his groundbreaking discoveries, and in some way interacts with the reader through his dialog.

Hooke also seemed to support and extend the idea that we can no longer only rely on our senses, but we have to learn to trust and adapt to using tools to understand more of the world around us. He states this very explicitly at the beginning of his work: "[the] only way which now remains for us to recover some degree of those former perfections, seems to be, by rectifying the operations of the Sense, the Memory, and Reason, since upon the evidence, the strength, the integrity, and the right correspondence of all these, all the light, by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed, and all our command over things it to be establisht" (Hooke, 2).

One of the similarities I found between Hooke and Galileo was the realization that "Science of Nature has been already too long made only a work of the Brain and the Fancy: It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of Observations on material and obvious things" (Hooke, 4). Galileo also seemed to want to utilize simple (or complex) instruments to try and study the world around him.

Questions:

1. Hooke discovered Hooke's law before he started at the Royal Society. I think at his time at Oxford. Why was he still just seen as a Mechanic and not a real physicist or a gentlemen?

Learnings:

Class:

- The Royal Society had a wrong picture of him for 300 years.
- Newton vs Hooke conflicts.
- "The fall": post-lapsarian world. After the Apple was eaten. We were thrown out of the Garden of Eden. Pre-lapsarian world vs Post-lapsarian world.
    - "Service" to God by studying the fundamentals of the world he created.
- "Even the filth of our world is beautiful", "Every aspect of reality is beautiful".
- Hooke: society structure is what limits.
- Ideal vs what a flea is.
    - Platonist would say that you're drawing the perfect flea.
    - Anti-Platonist would say that you're demonstrating and drawing a diagram/image to display the flea.
- The word "scientist": coined in 1833, William Whewell. (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417)
    - People would call Hooke a "Mechanic" or "Rude Mechanic" or "Rude Mechanical" - "Gentlemen don't have dirty hands".
    - Mechanical in six characters in A Midsummer Night's Dream. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_(character)
