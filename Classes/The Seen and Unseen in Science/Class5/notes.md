Reading X-ray:

- Pasveer, "Representing or mediating"

Quotes:

- Mechanical objectivity
- "[machines] produced not only more observations, but better observations" (Pasveer, 42).
- "X-ray photographs could be examined in the absence of the patient, they could be carried around and studied by anyone interested and competent" (Pasveer, 55)

Pre-notes:

- Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen: produced and detected electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range known as X-rays or Röntgen rays, an achievement that earned him the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.
- X is the algebraic symbol of the unknown. He never saw any ray like it so he decides to name it X-ray.

Response:

Out of the three readings we've done, this seemed like the most that showed doctors/scientists/businessmen that science and technology had the ability to directly improve everyone's lives, and not just for the scientific and rich to use it to understand the world. Science isn't a closed-box that serves to improve itself, but also the world around it. X-rays also became somewhat used and tested by a lot of labs and scientists very quickly - in 1895 Thomas Edison made some improvements on it, and by 1896 Dartmouth College was testing its ability detect a fracture (It doesn't hurt that post-Röntgen discovering the X-ray there were significant discoveries in Physics by Henri Becquerel, J.J. Thomson and Marie Curie).

There were significant improvements in other fields that pushed for validation of your work (in this case diagnosis) by use of instruments (such as telescopes). Through the discovery of X-rays this idea was reinforced, and physicians could more confidently validate their diagnosis. The unseen was made seen. At the time, though, the reports from the x-ray would have been unbelievable by the general audience (as we've seen in this reading). I imagined it being as if someone told us they were able to fully-map our own brains and it be able to tell you how information flows through it.

All three of the things we've seen have something to do with observing and coming out with a drawn final result. The drawn result has shown to be incredible powerful in the study of science and now in diagnosis as Pasveer writes "X-ray photographs could be examined in the absence of the patient, they could be carried around and studied by anyone interested and competent" (Pasveer, 55). To me, this represents a new world where you're able to study a living person while they are not there, and a world where you're able to reference exact details in past cases and match them. The learning from past cases is, in my opinion, very important as he enabled a way for us to pass on exact and repeatable medical knowledge (or any type of x-ray related knowledge) in the same way we pass on mathematics or history in books.
