Reading Intelligence:

- Stephen J. Gould, "Mismeasure of Man"

Quotes:

- ``How much better off we would be if all scientists submitted themselves to self-scrutiny in so forthright a fashion: `I want to state very explicitly,' Binet wrote (1900, p. 342), `what I have observed about myself. The details that follow are those that the majority of authors do not publish; one does not want to let them be known'" (Gould, 147).
- ``In 1912 the German psychologist W. Stern argued that mental age should be divided by chronological age, not subtracted from it and the intelligence quotient, or IQ, was born" (Gould, 150).
- ``True science progresses by induction from simple experiments pursued to gather basic facts, not to test elaborate theories" (Gould, 150).
- ``Intelligence, Binet proclaimed, is too complex to capture with a single number. This number, later called IQ, is only a rough, empirical guide constructed for a limited, practical purpose" (Gould, 151).
- "Not only did Binet decline to label IQ as inborn intelligence; he also refused to regard it as a general device for ranking pupils according to mental worth. he devised his scale only for the limited purpose of his commission by the ministry of education: as a practical guide for identifying children whose poor performance indicated a need for special education" (Gould, 152).
- "Without denying the evidence fact that not all children, whatever their training, will enter the company of Newton and Einstein, they emphasize the power of creative education to increase the achievements of all children, often in extensive and unanticipated ways. Mental testing becomes a theory for enhancing potential through proper education" (Gould, 153).
- "Alpha and Beta exams, the first mass-produced written tests of intelligence" (Gould, 195).
- "Yerkes argued that men with more innate intelligence spend more time in school" (Gould, 218).
- "The theory that native intelligence is one of the most important conditioning factors in continuance in school is certainly borne out by this accumulation of data" (Yerkes, 780).
- "Yerkes found that average test scores for foreign-born recruits rose consistently with years of residence in America" (Gould, 220).

    2. Knowledge representation (storing what it knows or hears)
    3. Automated reasoning (Use stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions)
    4. Machine Learning (to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns)
- Social structures
    - Rationality
    - Consciousness
    - Belief/Desires
    - Intuition
    - Common Sense
    - Decision theory
    - Survival skills

Response:

The reading shifted from having a exploratory tone to cautious tone very fast. The material went from Gould talking about testing ideas to Gould writing about ``[how] much better off we would be if all scientists submitted themselves to self-scrutiny" (Gould, 147). This reading reminded me of the power of science and what can be called facts on society. 

Moreover, I found it amazing that Yerkes explored areas where his theory didn't work, and attempted to figure out these edge cases. Gould writes "Yerkes found that average test scores for foreign-born recruits rose consistently with years of residence in America" (Gould, 220). Even though Yerkes had a clear bias against foreign-born recruits and was biased in his reasoning for why their average test scores improved, he still made an important discovery. He always able to show with data that lives of foreign-born recruits were significantly better after their move. Yerkes's clear bias showed when he wrote "men with more innate intelligence spend more time in school" (Gould, 218), and didn't account for the socioeconomic factors in foreign-countries.

Lastly, nowadays we're constantly being categorized into intelligence buckets even if we don't realize it, and it's gotten so common we either don't realize it's or know it's happening. Most of our middle-to-high-school education has created so the most intelligent middle-schoolers go on to being with the most intelligent high-schoolers. In addition, companies like Facebook also use your chat, comments, posts, and much more to rank your intelligence to decide the kinds of ads to serve you. So they're using your every-day conversations with your friends to use as a test to measure you using their intelligence metrics.

In reference to the article:

In Artificial Intelligence, some researchers spend time figuring out the skills that make us intelligent and break them down into categories so they can look at each particular category and extrapolate why it helps us be intelligent. Then they study the categories in groups and understand how they fit together. The most common representation of these skills or categories is:

1. Problem-solving, 2. Knowledge, reasoning, and planning, 3. Uncertain knowledge and reasoning, 4. Learning, 5. Communicating, perceiving, and acting.

Then they are able to translate these abilities into abilities a machine can do:

1. Natural language processing (communicate successfully in some language), 2. Knowledge representation (storing what it knows or hears), 3. Automated reasoning (Use stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions), 4. Machine Learning (to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns), 5. Communication, perceiving, and acting.

Therefore, even though they're able to build algorithms that are able to specifically target and solve a particular issue, it's really hard to build something that is generally intelligent like we are.
