Reading Intelligence:

- Stephen J. Gould, "Mismeasure of Man"

Quotes:

- ``How much better off we would be if all scientists submitted themselves to self-scrutiny in so forthright a fashion: `I want to state very explicitly,' Binet wrote (1900, p. 342), `what I have observed about myself. The details that follow are those that the majority of authors do not publish; one does not want to let them be known'" (Gould, 147).
- ``In 1912 the German psychologist W. Stern argued that mental age should be divided by chronological age, not subtracted from it and the intelligence quotient, or IQ, was born" (Gould, 150).
- ``True science progresses by induction from simple experiments pursued to gather basic facts, not to test elaborate theories" (Gould, 150).
- ``Intelligence, Binet proclaimed, is too complex to capture with a single number. This number, later called IQ, is only a rough, empirical guide constructed for a limited, practical purpose" (Gould, 151).
- "Not only did Binet decline to label IQ as inborn intelligence; he also refused to regard it as a general device for ranking pupils according to mental worth. he devised his scale only for the limited purpose of his commission by the ministry of education: as a practical guide for identifying children whose poor performance indicated a need for special education" (Gould, 152).
- "Without denying the evidence fact that not all children, whatever their training, will enter the company of Newton and Einstein, they emphasize the power of creative education to increase the achievements of all children, often in extensive and unanticipated ways. Mental testing becomes a theory for enhancing potential through proper education" (Gould, 153).
- "Alpha and Beta exams, the first mass-produced written tests of intelligence" (Gould, 195).
- "Yerkes argued that men with more innate intelligence spend more time in school" (Gould, 218).
- "The theory that native intelligence is one of the most important conditioning factors in continuance in school is certainly borne out by this accumulation of data" (Yerkes, 780).
- "Yerkes found that average test scores for foreign-born recruits rose consistently with years of residence in America" (Gould, 220).

Pre-notes:

- Binet test
- Yerkes (Psychological Examining in the United States Army).
- Intelligence
    1. Problem-solving
    2. Knowledge, reasoning, and planning
    3. Uncertain knowledge and reasoning
    4. Learning
    5. Communicating, perceiving, and acting
- AI needs to poses:
    1. Natural language processing (communicate successfully)
    2. Knowledge representation (storing what it knows or hears)
    3. Automated reasoning (Use stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions)
    4. Machine Learning (to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns)
- Social structures
    - Rationality
    - Consciousness
    - Belief/Desires
    - Intuition
    - Common Sense
    - Decision theory
