Reading Telescope II:

- Sidereus Nuncius, 57-86
- Cohen, "What Galileo saw: The experience of looking through a telescope"

Quotes:

- "Science no longer depended on the primary sense-imperssions of sight, feel, sound, taste, or smell, but rather on the output of a scientific instrument that became a mediator of the direct impressions of nature" (Cohen, 434).
- "His telescopes were better because he used lenses which he ground himself" (Cohen, 436).
- "He openly attacked the axioms of Aristotelian science. One of the most fundamental of these was the doctrine that the moon must be a smooth polished globe, since otherwise it could not move in circulation around the earth as the other 'planets' were supposed to do" (Cohen, 444).
- "The telescope thus offered Galileo wholly new grounds for undermining Aristotelian science, giving rise to a pressure to find earth-like physical characteristics in the nearest 'planet'" (Cohen, 444).
- "Jupiter has a system of four moons [implies] that to have an orbiting moon (as the earth does) does not inhibit planetary orbital motion" (Cohen, 444).
- "Moon was almost universally considered to be a smooth or polished ball, sharing the perfection of the heavenly bodies" (Cohen, 445).
- "One of the premises of the Copernican premises that posed most difficulty was that the earth is just another planet" (Cohen, 445).
- "if the earth is not unique, then it should follow that the earth is not the only planet with a satellite." (Cohen, 458).
- "if Jupiter could move in orbit and not lose four moons, surely there could be no objection to the earth's moving and not losing its single moon" (Cohen, 458).
- "He showed that he understood how the mind-set of an observer is a determining factor in what the observer 'sees' and imagines. In other and similar contexts, I studied this type of creativity by using the notion of converting the 'unknown' or 'unfamiliar' into the 'familiar' as a means of coping with a new experience" (Cohen, 459).
- "Substances exist and actions occur which are not merely remote from but completely beyond all our imaginings, lacking any resemblance to ours and therefore being entirely unthinkable" (Cohen, 460).
- "Many things herertofore invisible 'have become visible by a means of a telescope'" (Cohen, 461).

Pre-notes:

- Ranking of light was something Galileo understood well that was important in understanding the space of the moon.

Response:

- You could understand in his repeated attempts to understand the patterns that it wasn't something he had encountered before, and it was something that was above the realm of what people knew at the time. He repeatedly looked at Jupiter's stars in order to understand what exactly was happening, and he did this for many months, and precisely tried to lay out on a timely bases what was happening. 

Questions:

1. Uncertain whether the moon counts as heaven or not. Was lead to believe that everything after the moon was supposed to be this perfect and heavenly place. However is the moon counted in that? 

Learnings:

Galileo was a determined:

- Anti-Aristotelianism
- Copernicanism: the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System.
