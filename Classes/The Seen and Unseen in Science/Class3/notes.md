Reading Telescope II:

- Sidereus Nuncius, 57-86
- Cohen, "What Galileo saw: The experience of looking through a telescope"

Quotes:

- "Science no longer depended on the primary sense-impressions of sight, feel, sound, taste, or smell, but rather on the output of a scientific instrument that became a mediator of the direct impressions of nature" (Cohen, 434).
- "His telescopes were better because he used lenses which he ground himself" (Cohen, 436).
- "He openly attacked the axioms of Aristotelian science. One of the most fundamental of these was the doctrine that the moon must be a smooth polished globe, since otherwise it could not move in circulation around the earth as the other 'planets' were supposed to do" (Cohen, 444).
- "The telescope thus offered Galileo wholly new grounds for undermining Aristotelian science, giving rise to a pressure to find earth-like physical characteristics in the nearest 'planet'" (Cohen, 444).
- "Jupiter has a system of four moons [implies] that to have an orbiting moon (as the earth does) does not inhibit planetary orbital motion" (Cohen, 444).
- "Moon was almost universally considered to be a smooth or polished ball, sharing the perfection of the heavenly bodies" (Cohen, 445).
- "One of the premises of the Copernican premises that posed most difficulty was that the earth is just another planet" (Cohen, 445).
- "if the earth is not unique, then it should follow that the earth is not the only planet with a satellite." (Cohen, 458).
- "if Jupiter could move in orbit and not lose four moons, surely there could be no objection to the earth's moving and not losing its single moon" (Cohen, 458).
- "He showed that he understood how the mind-set of an observer is a determining factor in what the observer 'sees' and imagines. In other and similar contexts, I studied this type of creativity by using the notion of converting the 'unknown' or 'unfamiliar' into the 'familiar' as a means of coping with a new experience" (Cohen, 459).
- "Substances exist and actions occur which are not merely remote from but completely beyond all our imaginings, lacking any resemblance to ours and therefore being entirely unthinkable" (Cohen, 460).
- "Many things heretofore invisible 'have become visible by a means of a telescope'" (Cohen, 461).

Pre-notes:

- Ranking of light was something Galileo understood well that was important in understanding the space of the moon.

Response:

In the second half of Sidereus Nuncius, Galileo made repeated attempts to understand the patterns of the four moons of Jupiter. He repeatedly looked at Jupiter's stars in order to understand what exactly was happening. He did this for many months and precisely tried to lay out a framework to measure the distances between Jupiter's stars and Jupiter, and the distance between each of the stars. Unlike the first half, he focuses on more on the mathematics of the celestial objects and less on their artistic depictions. However, even in the second half his drawings help visualize and depict his confusion (and later clarity) of how the stars were moving.

In his paper, "What Galileo Saw: The Experience of Looking through a Telescope", Cohen repeatedly mentions and tries to stress the idea that Galileo wasn't the first one to either point the telescope upwards nor the person who invented the telescope. But, that Galileo was the first one to introduce the notion that "[science] no longer depended on the primary sense-impressions of sight, feel, sound, taste, or smell, but rather on the output of a scientific instrument that became a mediator of the direct impressions of nature" (Cohen, 434). Cohen writes that "[Galileo shows] that he understood how the mind-set of an observer is a determining factor in what the observer 'sees' and imagines. In other and similar contexts, I studied this type of creativity by using the notion of converting the 'unknown' or 'unfamiliar' into the 'familiar' as a means of coping with a new experience" (Cohen, 459). Galileo had an excellent intuition in utilizing his artistic ability to intrigue people, and then using his mathematical and reasoning skills to convince them or at least implant the idea. Through both of his findings he begins to raise ideas such as: "if Jupiter could move in orbit and not lose four moons, surely there could be no objection to the earth's moving and not losing its single moon" (Cohen, 458), and "if the earth is not unique, then it should follow that the earth is not the only planet with a satellite." (Cohen, 458). 

Questions:

1. Uncertain whether the moon counts as heaven or not. Was lead to believe that everything after the moon was supposed to be this perfect and heavenly place. However is the moon counted in that? 

Learnings:

Galileo was a determined:

- Anti-Aristotelianism
- Copernicanism: the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System.
