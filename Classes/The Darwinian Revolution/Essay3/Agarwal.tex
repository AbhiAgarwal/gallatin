% REVOLUTION? What exactly is revolutionary about the Darwinian revolution? Imagine that a friend or relative who knows you are taking this course asked you this question. How would you answer? Is it the positive contributions to knowledge? The dangerous philosophical implications suggested by Gould and others? The cynical answer to the meaning of human existence suggested by Vonnegut? Or by Dawkins? How would you articulate the dimensions of the Darwinian revolution?

\par Darwin's theory of evolution caused a shift in how people perceived the world, and tried to understand their surroundings. Slack, in his book `The Battle over the Meaning of Everything', writes ``what [the dover trials were] really about was neither evolution nor ID, but the worldviews they enabled" (Slack, 39-40). Slack points out something very important and fundamental idea that Darwin's theory revolutionized the way individuals thought about the world, their worldview, and was not just a theory that needed to be applied. It dramatically shifted people's view of different fields, different concepts and introduced new ideas to fields that it wouldn't directly be applicable to.

% 1. EXPLAINING AND DEFINITION DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION TO CREATE A BASE.

\par Talk about defining and explaining Darwin's theory that could cause revolutions, and how it could create shifts in understanding.

\par Different ways of defining, and understanding the theory. It leaves it more open-ended and open for people to interpret and adapt to their own understanding of the 
world.

% OPINIONS ON DEFINITION OF EVOLUTION

\par Moreover, another interesting observation is that different people who have written about theories involving Darwin's theory have different views of defining natural selection or the theory of evolution. This is interesting to observe as it depicts the ways these authors have thought about these theories, and applied it in their own ways. 

It's important to understand the worldview that is being represented under the authors theory, and a definition is one way of beginning to understand what the author represents.

Pagel, in his book `Wired for Culture: Origins of the Human Social Mind', writes ``Natural selection does not maximize happiness or even well-being, but rather long-term reproductive success" (Pagel, 24).

Dawkins, in his book 'The Selfish Gene', ``[although] evolution may seem, in some vague sense, `good thing', especially since we are a product of it, nothing actually `wants' to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the effort of the replicators (and nowadays of the genes) to prevent it happening" (Dawkins, 19).

% 1. THEORIES PREVIOUS TO DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION - BRIEF INTRODUCTION

\par Talk about how people applied their understanding/thoughts before Darwin's theories

% THESIS:
% THESIS THAT DARWIN'S THEORY CREATED A REVOLUTION BY ALLOWING US TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS CHANGED OR ADAPTED, AND WHY THEY CHANGED OR ADAPTED. 
% There as no framework to explain how things such as culture before, but now there exists a theory that allows us t	o explain everything. 

% 1. PRESENT DEFINITIONS OF HOW SLACK & PAGEL VIEW HIS THEORY OF EVOLUTION
% 2. HOW THEY BOTH DEFINED EVOLUTION, OR NATURAL SELECTION.

\par Talk about people's thoughts and representations after his theory came out.

\par Pagel looks at how languages evolve by applying the biological evolution and nature selection theory as a template. 

``Evolution, he said, permits a relativistic, purposeless, Godless view of the world, in which self-aggrandizement and pleasure are sufficient ends in themselves, and the only objective measure of goodness is reproductive fitness." (Slack, 40-41)

``Our invention of culture around that time created an entirely new sphere of evolving entities. Humans had acquired the ability to learn from others, and to copy, imitate and improve upon their actions" (Pagel, 2).

``Our cultural survival vehicles were built not from coalitions of genes but from coalitions of ideas roped together by cultural evolution" (Page, 46).
