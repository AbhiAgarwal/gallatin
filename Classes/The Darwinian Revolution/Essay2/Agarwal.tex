% Background information
% Galton's Introduction
% Galton -> Father of Behavioral Statistics, 
% Will our children be born with more virtuous dispositions, if we ourselves have acquired virtuous habits? Or are we no more than passive transmitters of a nature we have received, and which we have no power to modify? (http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Galton/talent.htm)
\par Eugenics was born out an interpretation of the theory of evolution. Francis Galton who was a half-cousin to Charles Darwin desired to apply Darwin's theory that explained the development of plants and animal species to humans. Galton found the idea of questioning natural selections in humans intriguing and coined the term eugenics, which tried to improve the quality of our society by applying the principles of Darwinism to the human population. 

% Meaning of the word Eugenics
% http://www.eubios.info/EJ93/ej93e.htm
% science of improving stock-not only by judicious mating, but whatever tends to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had.

\par Self-direction of human evolution. Darwinism could be seen as the identify of eugenics, and not the root of eugenics.

% Darwin's theory. Was it correctly derived? Was Darwin actually implying this or not.
% Was he just inspired, or did Darwin actually imply it in his work?
% Galton coins the term after Darwin's Death.

% Sterilization law in USA
% Davenport
\par Darwin's influence on the elite shaped the way research, development, and progress was made in major nations such as the United States. The majority of individuals in the United States rejected Darwinism, however some of the leaders, intellectuals, scientists, and biologists believed in the theory and so it was applied in many scientific, economic, and intellectual discussions and proposals in the United States.
