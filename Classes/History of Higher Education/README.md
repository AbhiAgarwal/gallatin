# Final Paper

- My paper was titled: "How we defaulted to having professional schools, specifically business schools and law schools, and how they became the norm after 1881 in the United States".
- The teacher gave me comments on this paper:
	- Page 1. In the US, the move towards graduate-level professional education began in the 19th century and it continues in such fields as physical and occupational therapy.
	- Page 2: "separation into two distinct institutions". As we saw in the article by Hawkins, often it was the other way around: universities incorporated free-standing professional schools.
	- Page 2: "enroll and obtain a law degree within a 4 year period.". Please explain this comment. Do you mean four years from the time of admission to higher education?
	- Page 3: "a larger percentage of individuals" How much larger? 
	- Page 3: "already their undergraduate degree," and "moved their degrees from an undergraduate level to a graduate level". These sentences seem to be saying different things. Please clarify.
	- Pages 3 and 4. Please clarify this paragraph. Harvard resisted awarding the J.D. degree for many years. Compare its rationale for the late 1960s change to Harper's rational more than a half century earlier.
	- Page 5. Most states now require attendance at law school prior to admission to the Bar.
	- Page 5. When did the "quick start" debate occur at Harvard? Did Harvard offer undergraduate studies in the law before 1969? Carefully distinguish between the move to the J.D. and the move to a seven-year postsecondary course of studies leading to a law degree. You suggest here that the difference between an L.L.B. and a J.D. was less consequential (maybe inconsequential) than the debate over the length of time to a law degree. Additionally, some lawyers opposed the part-time law school, which often catered to working students (see the 1922 Reed Report).
	- Page 6. You've mentioned an American practice of "teaching law at undergraduate level and practicing it at graduate level". What does this mean? American students can apply to law school after having majored in many different subjects as undergraduates.
	- Page 7: Please clarify: "based on case-studies and practicing rather than academia". there other other models for business education besides case studies.
	- Page 8: "most of these undergraduate business schools have moved" Actually, business is the largest undergraduate major in the US.
