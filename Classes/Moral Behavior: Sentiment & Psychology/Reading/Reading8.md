#### Grounding

Morality is about the realm of freedom. That's what pratical reason concerns itself with. 
- We can't choose if the laws of the universe exists.
- Practical reasoning is always grounded on desire

Categories: 

1. Assumptions

- Autonomy (p41, p60): All laws that we should follow should be laws that an autonomous agent would choose.
- Autonomous agent: A being of the understanding or the intellect.

2. Conditions

- King of the ends (p39)
	- The thought experiment proposes a world in which all human beings are treated as ends (meaning treated as if they and their well-being are the goal), not as means to an end for other people.
	- All moral agents are ends in themselves.
- Universal law giver proviso (p38)
	- proviso: a condition attached to an agreement.
- Means/ends (p36)
	- Kisok both dispense tickets. Kisok is an end because if a Kisok stops working we can leave and move on to the next one.
	- People also sell tickets. If a person has a heart attack during selling you tickets then you have a duty because they are a means. We wouldn't leave them behind.
	- means:
	- Deterrence is the use of punishment as a threat to deter people from offending.
- Universal Law (p30)
	- p21
