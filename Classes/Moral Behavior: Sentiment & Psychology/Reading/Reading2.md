Nicomacheam Ethics

### Book 3

- Chapter 1 distinguishes actions which are chosen as the ones relevant to virtue, and whether actions are to be blamed, forgiven or even pitied
- Aristotle divides actions into three categories instead of two:
	1. Voluntary acts
	2. Involuntary acts
		- Simplest case where people do not praise or blame
		- In such cases a person does not choose the wrong thing
	3. "Non-voluntary" or "non willing" actions
