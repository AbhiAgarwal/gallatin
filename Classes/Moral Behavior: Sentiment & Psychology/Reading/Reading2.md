Nicomacheam Ethics

### Book 3

- Chapter 1 distinguishes actions which are chosen as the ones relevant to virtue, and whether actions are to be blamed, forgiven or even pitied
- Aristotle divides actions into three categories instead of two:
	1. Voluntary acts
		- The person is still in control of his or her actions
	2. Involuntary acts or unwilling actions
		- Performed under compulsion and causes pain to the person acting
		- Simplest case where people do not praise or blame
		- In such cases a person does not choose the wrong thing
		- Something done in ignorance may be called involuntary if the person later recognizes that ignorance, but it is nonvoluntary if the person does not recognize or suffer for such ignorance.
	3. "Non-voluntary" or "non willing" actions
		- Bad actions done by choice
		- More generally when "the source of the moving of the parts that are instrumental in such actions is in oneself" and the actions are "up to oneself either to do or not".
- Edge Cases:
	- Someone is compelled to do something dishonorable under threat
		- But we should generally consider such cases voluntary, since the person is still in control of his or her actions.
- What we deliberate upon is what we decide to do.
- Deliberate choice: seems to determine one's character more than one's actions do. 
	- Things done on the spur of the moment, and things done by animals and children can be willing, but driven by desire and spirit and not what we would normally call true choice.
	- Choice is rational, and according to the understanding of Aristotle, choice can be in opposition to desire.
	- Choice is also not wishing for things one does not believe can be achieved, such as immortality, but rather always concerning ***realistic aims***.
	- Our choices make us the type of person we are.
	- Before a choice is made there is a rational deliberation or thinking things through.
- Deliberation: "We deliberate about things that are up to us and are matters of action"
	- Deliberation is therefore not how we reason about ends we pursue.
		- Deliberation is how we think through the ways we can try to achieve them.
	- Choice then is decided by both desire and deliberation.
- Wishing: is not deliberation.
	- What is wished for is always what appears good (this is very variable).
	- Most importantly we could say that a worthy (spoudaios) man will wish for what is "truly" good.
- Virtue and vice according to Aristotle are "up to us"
	- vice: immoral or wicked behavior
	- although no one is willingly unhappy, vice by definition always involves actions which were decided upon willingly
	- People would have to be unconscious not to realize the importance of allowing themselves to live badly, and he dismisses any idea that different people have different innate visions of what is good.
