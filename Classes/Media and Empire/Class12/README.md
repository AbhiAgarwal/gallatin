- Fanon's definition of nationalism:
    - Trump is an interesting character to differentiate with what Fanon thinks about as nationalism.
- Violence is necessary and inevitable.
    - His acknowledgment of diplomatic and political systems that exist.
    - "Colonized intellectuals". He doesn't lump everyone in the colonized society into a colony, but has a distinction for them.
    - "Poltics vs violence"
    - What prevents them having a reasonable discourse:
        - Intersection of class and race.
    - Political elites -- benefit through access to economical power. A lot of people in these countries benefit from colonial power both politically and economically.
        - They are the ones who are running to the negotiating table.
- Colonized masses are double at a disadvantage. They don't benefit from the colonization or capitalism, but the political elites do.
    - The co-operative nature of the alliance of the political elite and the colonized.
- Bourgeoisie: Means of production and capital
    - Power should move from the bourgeois to the state so it could be redistributed.

    - Executive individuals in the state.
    - "Security apparatus of the state".
