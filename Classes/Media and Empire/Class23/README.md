"I raise this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today, no matter the cause. At times, this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America, the world's sole military superpower."

"Manning is already in danger of being forgotten (though not at this website) for an alleged act that was aimed at stopping war, an act that -- as a matter of amends -- should bring him a nomination for the Nobel Prize, if not the prize itself"

"We have clear U.S. military documentation of sexual torture, of amputated fingers and limbs, of beatings so severe they regularly resulted in death".

"The young private saw very clearly what so many professors and generals take pains to deny: that the primary function of the laws of war is not to restrain violence, but to justify it, often with the greatest lawyerly ingenuity"

"Let’s be clear: what killed the civilians walking the streets of Baghdad that day in 2007 was not “war crimes,” but war"

"Just days after airstrikes began against the Qaddafi government, a Human Rights Watch researcher called Corinne Dufka called for ‘nothing less than the type of unified and decisive action the UN Security Council has brought to bear in Libya’ to be employed in Côte d’Ivoire in an article published in Foreign Policy"

Harold Koh is the former dean of Yale Law School and an expert in human rights law. As the State Department’s senior lawyer between 2009 and 2013, he provided the Obama administration with the legal basis for assassination carried out by drones.

"Many humanitarian lawyers seem to have persuaded themselves that war can be conducted with clinical precision given the advances in both military technology and the laws that govern how war should be fought – jus in bello."

### Class notes

- Chase Madar
- Media, Empire & Law.
- Wars: most of the answers against wars are because they are "illegal".
- "Laws of war": rules of engagement. Ted Cruz feels that they are holding America back. They should just carpet bomb ISIS.
- American right:
    - Law restraining warfare is a bad thing.
    - This is a scapegoat for failed military strategies. You question how the war was conducted rather than military strategies.
    - "Stabbing in the back legend": The stab-in-the-back myth (German: Dolchstoßlegende) was the notion, widely believed in right-wing circles in Germany after 1918, that the German Army did not lose World War I but was instead betrayed by the civilians on the home front, especially the republicans who overthrew the monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918–19. Advocates denounced the German government leaders who signed the Armistice on November 11, 1918, as the "November Criminals" (German: Novemberverbrecher).
    - Vietnam Dolchstoßlegende for the U.S: journalists.
    - Iraq Dolchstoßlegende for the U.S: very hard to come up with any problems for the US in comparison to Vietnam. We have to look at what we have to blame, and the rules of war are one thing we can blame.
    - Rules of war are a lubricant for war: takes moral and ethical liability from the soldiers.
    - Expressly grants authority to the entities involved.
    - Defense agency contracts 15,000 lawyers.
    - Carpet bombing is a very ineffective tactic:
        - Failure of strategic bombing can be seen in Vietnam, Laos, etc.
    - Discourse about drones: swiftly turns into law talks.
        - Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan, Philippines, Syria, Somalia
        - Is the legal issue of drones the only issue with drones?
        - Is it of "vital" U.S. interest?
- War is actually "pretty" good: "arm of policy". If we have war without "war crimes".
    - War is hell and war is inherently nasty.
    - "Right wing talking point":
- right-winged: "Tying hand behind the back".
    - holds up law in a strong force
- liberal/moderate: "Clean targeting decisions", "Turn counter-insurgency into a peacecorp project".
- There's no need to address the language: in the past a lot of people were forced to go into war, and your son/daughter could have been conscripted at any point.
- Military logistics: laws of war.
- Anti war movement
- Books: Strategies by Luttwak, Wrong Turn by Gian Gentile, and Counterinsurgency by Douglas Porch.
- 1971: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3478510/
- War, even done well, is evil.
