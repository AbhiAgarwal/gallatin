### Essay

The thing that surprises me the most in the chapters we have read in the last couple weeks has been the self determent nature of the leaders of Philippines. They were not only participating in the violence and problems, but also contributing to it. It has become clear, to me, that the problems that stemmed in Philippines were not only caused by the leaders in the U.S., but also the corrupt Filipino leaders. The decisions they made to either cut or inflate costs, or partner with the U.S. even though they understood the repressions of that were made without exploring the consequences to its citizens. McCoy writes, "with their acute sensitivity to the nuances of American policy honed by a century of close interactions, Filipino leaders quickly divined the inner logic Washington's war on terror and played on it to turn the alliance to partisan advancements, unleashing deadly force that stifled social change" (499). This juxtaposes to the decision they made to bring 1,200 troops from the U.S. Defense Department "to the southern Philippines, including 190 special operations forces who would train the Philippine military in counter-terrorism techniques and six thousand conventional troops to stiffen its fight against the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group on Basilan Island" (511). There seemed to be a dysfunction in the decisions they made since they did not tackle the root problem, but focused on fighting against gangs or people who were strictly against the state. The tactic here seemed to be for the leaders to stay in power rather than for them to help fix social issues.
