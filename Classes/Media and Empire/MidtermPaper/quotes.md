"war transforms technology and industry, so colonialism plays a comparable role for government, producing innovations, particularly in the use of coercive controls, with a profound impact on its bureaucracies both home and abroad ... experiments whose lessons were later repatriated through policies and personnel" (McCoy, 37).

- This is particularly interesting since it shows the experimental aim that the U.S. might have when it seeks to invade the Philippines.

"America appears less as exceptional and more as a pioneer in the history and technology of settler colonialism" (Mamdani, 608)

- we discussed the idea of media as technology and as infrastructure was important

McCoy discussed the use of the national police and how post-independence "remained a key instrument of both legal and extralegal presidential power" (McCoy, 16)

The control of both the national police and the media allowed them to selectively govern the political situation in the Philippines. They could control both the wires and the content.

Policing strategies in the Philippines overcame the obstacles posed by geographical vastness by using technologies like the telegraph, telephones, and undercover spies as methods to maintain knowledge of any Filipino insurgent or anti-US activities.


- There seems to be no need for informational technology when pacifying the allegedly “savage” Natives because any anti-colonial activity could be quenched by their physical limitations and political exclusion.

The government (agencies such as the PC) utilized newfound technologies like the telegraph, data management systems, and telephones to control and navigate the flow of information, and to repress politically unfavorable or subversive voices in the Philippines: “The colonial security services… succeeded in demobilizing a deeply rooted national revolution and advancing a conservative elite to fill the political void” (16). Subsequently, the colonial security model was applied within the United States as well.

In the first chapter of his work, McCoy talks about how the policing of Philippines can be seen as a technology, just as the Catholic Church or the government are commonly referred to as institutions. One of the first conclusions of McCoy’s argument is that “the creation of sophisticated modern policing was crucial to the U.S. pacification of the Philippines” (page 16). Developments in technology in general such as Edison’s telegraph and Bell’s telephone suddenly allowed for transmission of information fast and over great distances.

The U.S. used these developments in technology to develop a security system with the newly invaded Philippines being the perfect place to experiment with a new infrastructure. Just as the first settlers that colonialized America claimed that the land was inhabited, that it was a clean slate on which they established a new nation so were the Philippines perceived as clean slate for developing a new police system in the colony as well as in the center.

“a social experiment in the use of police as an instrument of power” (McCoy, 16)

------

The technology being tested was how to best police a state - the state being a “that [which] claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory” (McCoy, 20). Compare this sentiment to Mamdani who states that “a strong central power [in the US] did develop...to destroy slavery and to wage colonial wars- first against Indian tribes, then against neighbors, and then in the world at large” (10).

The frontier was a growing opportunity; Mamdani quotes Jackson Turner who cites it as “[stimulating] invention and rugged individualism, and was the important element in the formation of a distinctively ‘American’ character” (8).
