% Material as well as symbolic dimensions that have shaped "Territorial or military control"

% Colonialist gets more powerful as it does experimentation
\par Colonial power gets stronger at home and in other nations it will seek to colonize as it learns from its military and political experimentation. In his book, `Policing America's Empire', McCoy discusses in depth the advantage that the colonialist power gets from experimenting abroad, specifically in Philippines. He writes, one way that America uses its colonization over Philippines is as ``a social experiment in the use of police as an instrument of power" (McCoy, 16). 

\par ``war transforms technology and industry, so colonialism plays a comparable role for government, producing innovations, particularly in the use of coercive controls, with a profound impact on its bureaucracies both home and abroad ... experiments whose lessons were later repatriated through policies and personnel" (McCoy, 37).

% Experimentation not only helps the colonist get stronger at home, but also in that country as it recognizes what works
\par Experimentation helps the colonialist power learn about what works and what does not in that state.
\par Give example of America learning about filipino control of media and of rigging elections.

% Having better technology means that it has dominance over other countries. This is because the colonialist powers saw this as being more superior.

% Material as well as symbolic dimensions that have shaped "Racial and cultural supremacy"

% Discuss how anti-colonial thinkers address the power of media infrastructure and culture in their writings
