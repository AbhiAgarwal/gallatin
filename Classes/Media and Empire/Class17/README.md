- Radio Cairo and the Decolonization of East Africa, 1953-1964:
    - Tensions of Arab-Afro solidarity. Tension is between the difference between radicalism and paternalism. What are the main arguments:
        - Egypt, Zanzibar: how do you build solidarity when one country is more "progressed".
    - The beating of drums: used to unite the pan-African community.
    - Generic anti-colonialism. It's hard to build something on top of anti-something. You have to shift to something positive and build something positive on top of that.
    - The paternalism of these projects.
        - What does it mean to "save" these people. Why are you trying to be so paternal about these people? How can you classify them as one being? These are very big issues in the post-colonialist world.

    - Government power over feminism.
    - What was the role of the government in creating this.
    - Socialism feminism.
