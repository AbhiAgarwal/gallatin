### March 31st:

- Thomas Burgess explores the struggle to achieve an African identity using Zanzibarâ€™s history as an example.

- how to project a unique African personality and identity in a world in which the West's neocolonial colonial influence appeared virtually unassailable (2324-2325)

Burgess

Zanzibar explored the successes of the Chinese in their search "for a usable future resulted in the appropriation of China not only as an example of a nonwhite nation with solid anticolonial credentials, or an impoverished people that in a very short period of time appeared to have achieved miracles of nation building" (2338*). The culture and descriptions of Zanzibar at this point in history seem very interesting -- they described themselves as a mixture of many different countries and cultures. They sold goods in their stores, such as "a Japanese calendar, with pictures of delicately-lit paper houses and miniature bushes of blazing azaleas. leas. Or [a] Lebanese grapes nestling in tissue-paper, in fruit boxes stamped with a silhouette of a cedar tree, or Iraqi dates in packets illustrated with a painting of an oasis" (2378*). Even though there was diversity and their "big world did not have to be European" (2378*), they still felt like the European world and culture was one to aim to. To me, this seems unexpected as I would have thought they would not have wanted to be like the Europeans if they are trying to learn from the Chinese culture. The teenagers were listening to rock n' roll and dressing up in western clothing while the older population wanted to stick to traditional culture. This seems like issues that still exist in a lot of post-colonial countries today.

A lot of the text we have read portrays the Zanzibarian people as attempting to rebuild their cultural identities, and there being a confusion in the cultures they want to be similar to in the colonial and post-colonial world. Their attempts at learning from Chinese culture were inevitably unsuccessful, but I believe the search for identity is important to focus on and explore further.
