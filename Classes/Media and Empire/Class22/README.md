### Essay

Some of this essay is just my reactions and thoughts after reading this article. I haven't spent much time thinking about political issues in the past so a lot of what I have started to understand after this article is new to me --

I found Mamdani's article to be relevant to political issues that I talk to a lot of my peers about & answers to a lot of topics we discuss. The central issue I find fascinating is that when it comes to war in the Western world we refer to entities in these countries as countries rather than as religions. When the debate comes to the Middle East we discuss them as Muslims rather than as countries. I believe that the discussion around separation of Church and State is very important here given the fact that media (Western or not) separates Church and State in the western world, but not in the Middle-East (specifically). With this people separate individual people and group them together by their religious ideologies rather than their political stances. Mamdani's explanation regarding this is very important: "Islamist organizations will have to consider seriously the separation of the state from religion, notably as Hezbollah has in Lebanon, Instead of creating a national political Islam for each Muslim-majority state, the real challenge faced by Muslims is to shed the very notion of a nation-state" (Mahmood, 774).

I find this incredibly insightful as it shifts my focus from the talking about the perception of separation of Church and State with Western media to with Islamist organizations. Is it in the advantage of Islamist organizations to not separate Church and State? I am not too certain about this idea, but would like to explore this in more detail. In addition, Mamdani writes, "if terrorism were simply an individual crime, it would not be a political problem, The distinction between political terror and crime is that the former makes an open claim for support" (Mahmood, 773). This is one of the most important points he makes regarding my questions.
