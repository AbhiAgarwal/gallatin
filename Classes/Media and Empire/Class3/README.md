## Notes

- Settler colonialism is a form of colonial formation whereby foreign people move into a region. An imperial power oversees the immigration of these settlers who consent, often only temporarily, to government by that authority.
- "Africa is the continent where settler colonialism has been defeated; America is where settler colonialism triumphed."
- The American autobiography is written as the autobiography of the settler. The native has no place in it. The official museum built in Washington, D.C. to commemorate this history is called the Museum of the American Indian, not the Museum of the Native American. Most American tribes call themselves Indians, not natives. The reluctance to speak of themselves as Native Americans springs from a profound sense of not being a part of America as a political community.
- The difference between the voluntary immigrant and the involuntary nonimmigrant is not just the difference between the US and Europe; it also captures a key difference inside the US.
- Walzer argues that American pluralism was an artifact of the majority race.
    - Walzer imagines America as a neutral state, a European majority comprised of immigrants instead of settlers, slaves, and natives. American pluralism, says Walzer, is not a sign of an empire but of an immigrant society.
    - Classical pluralism is the view that politics and decision making are located mostly in the framework of government, but that many non-governmental groups use their resources to exert influence. The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process.
- Surely Walzer’s contrast between Old World corporatism (where groups are assigned members) and American voluntarism (where membership is self-assigned) holds only for ethnic groups that comprised the Euro (white) settler majority, not for racial groups that are nonwhite
- For Walzer Europe is tribal and America is multi-cultural
- Immigrant societies (Israel, America, Canada) are better understood as settler societies.
- Israeli exceptionalism
- Walzer tends to naturalize the history of race and conquest. He says of the US: “the boundaries of the new country, like those of every other country, were determined by war and diplomacy,” and “immigration . . . determined the character of its inhabitants” (W, p. 58).
- Socialism: a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.
- Indians were herded into semicaptivity in enclosures known as reservations; initiated by Lincoln after the Civil War, the development of these reservations accelerated under President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. The first great postrevolutionary era of democratic reform in US history, the Reconstruction closed the door firmly on any hopes of including Indians in the political community called the United States. The most poignant and searching autonarratives in the American autobiography concern the race question, not the native question. More than any other issue, race—and increasingly gender—has been at the cutting edge of reform in America.
- Not only are there important differences in the political and social location of African Americans and American Indians, these differences also translate into the lack of a shared perspective on emancipation and strategies for it.
- For the settler, African Americans signified labor; in contrast, American Indians were the source of land. If settlers sought to master African slaves as individuals, they set about conquering American Indians as entire tribes. In the language of the law, the African American was like a dog that could be tamed, but the Indian American was more like a cat that remained wild.
- Looked at from this vantage point, the American experience is both exceptional and pioneering. If the US is exceptional, it is not because of what it lacks but because of what it is. One autobiography of America sees the country as the first new nation, the child of the first modern anticolonial revolution. A single-minded celebration of this history has hidden from public consciousness a fact far more constitutive of America: the conquest and decimation of American Indians. America is not just the first new nation; it is also the first modern settler state. What is exceptional about America, the USA, is that it has yet to pose the question of decolonization in the public sphere.
- Inserted in the history of colonialism, America appears less as exceptional and more as a pioneer in the history and technology of settler colonialism. All the defining institutions of settler colonialism were produced as technologies of native control in North America. The first of these was the concentration of natives in tribal homelands.

## Class discussion

- Colonialism:
    - Direct rule vs indirect rule
- Imperialism:
    - Assumes unequal power that can be exercised through indirect control
- There's colonialism and imperialism in terms of trade
- Colonialism and Empire pre-date European colonialism
- Modern colonial power: "Modern" is important -- the world that changes post 1450.
- 16th century colonialism changes decisively: the technological innovations allow travel between different countries and regions to happen.
- Media as a technology; as an infrastructure. We think of media as an art, but media is also an infrastructure. It's a system of logistics. It's both the wires and the content.
- The infrastructural control is important when we think about media.
- European colonialism became possible when moving large number of people became possible. How do you exercise political sovereignty over thousands of miles?
- What is liberal: What do we mean there?
    - Liberty in terms of freedom from.
    - Individual property
- Freedom also has a negative connotation to it. We're seeking freedom from.
    - Negative vs positive freedom
    - The notion of choice (individual choice and individual freedom)
- Alexis de Tocqueville
- "gendered notions of having opinions"
- There was a blank state in American so they were able to mould it in their own way.
    - The Church is above all.
- Only Europeans were allowed to understand "history" and "culture".
- There's paternalism in the country such as the US who is coming to help the infant in Africa. This is about what America feels it's doing rather than something which exists.
- Egalitarianism
- Exceptionalism:
- If America’s greatest social successes have been registered on the frontier of race, the same cannot be said of the frontier of colonialism. If the race question marks the cutting edge of American reform, the native question highlights the limits of that reform. The thrust of American struggles has been to deracialize but not to decolonize. A deracialized America still remains a settler society and a settler state.
