### March 1st: Anti-Colonial Nationalism

- Césaire, Aimé (2000) Discourse on Colonialism. Monthly Review Press: Selections.
- Fanon, Frantz (1947) The Wretched of the Earth, Grove: 1-62.

The Wretched of the Earth is a 1961 book by Frantz Fanon, a psychiatric and psychologic analysis of the dehumanising effects of colonization upon the individual, and the nation, from which derive the broader social, cultural, and political implications inherent to establishing a social movement for the decolonization of a person and of a people. The French-language title derives from the opening lyrics of "The Internationale", the 19th-century anthem of the Left Wing.

The Wretched of the Earth presents thorough critiques of nationalism and of imperialism, a discussion of personal and societal mental health, a discussion of how the use of language (vocabulary) is applied to the establishment of imperialist identities, such as colonizer and colonized in order to teach and psychologically mold the native and the colonist into their respective roles as slave and master, and a discussion of the role of the intellectual in a revolution.

Fanon proposes that revolutionaries should seek the help of the lumpenproletariat to provide the force required to effect the expulsion of the colonists.

lumpenproletariat: describe the layer of the working class that is unlikely ever to achieve class consciousness and is therefore lost to socially useful production, of no use to the revolutionary struggle, and perhaps even an impediment to the realization of a classless society.

Moreover, in traditional Marxist theory, the lumpenproletariat are considered the lowest, most degraded stratum of the proletariat social-class — especially criminals, vagrants, and the unemployed — people who lacked the class consciousness to actively participate in the anti-colonial revolution.

The native must realize that colonialism never gives anything away for nothing. (142).

    - Hitler v Trump:
- Fascism: meaning -- authoritarianism, extreme nationalism, ethno-nationalism, complete governmental control of ideas.
    - What is the parallel Cesaire is drawing here:
    - Certain groups of people not being quite human, and so violence against certain people is not seen as violence.
- Colonialism as a mirror effect.
- The kind of progress that Europe has brought about is being questioned.
- The idea of dignity in colonialist societies.
