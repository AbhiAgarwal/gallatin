We will be watching a number of full-length films and documentaries during the course
of the semester. You are required to submit two short (2 page) film reviews of any two
of the films we watch over the course of the semester for a total of 5 points each. Film
Reviews are always due at the beginning of the class following the screening/viewing of
the film.

Film Reviews are meant to incorporate your analysis of the film with at least two
relevant texts from class. For example, for “The Real Glory,” you can use any two
of the following: McCoy, McClintock, Balce or Shohat & Stam.

Your reviews should address specific themes discussed in the readings (i.e. tropes
of empire in Hollywood films, commodification of race, gender/sexuality and
empire, etc.) and in class and examine the film in relation to those themes.
Reviews are not meant to be assessments of the aesthetic or entertainment value
of the films in and of themselves.

These are meant to be short (2 page double spaced) assignments, and so you
should refrain from sources outside of those assigned in class. If using materials
assigned for class, please use in-text citation (i.e. McCoy, 250). If you feel it
necessary to draw from any outside materials, please provide full citation of those
materials.
