### Notes

- "Advertising's chief contribution to the culture of modernity was the discovery that by manipulating the semiotic space around the commodity, the unconscious as a public space could also be manipulated" (McClintock, 213).
- "A white boy, clothed in a white apron bends benevolently over his "lesser" brother, bestowing upon him the precious talisman of racial progress" (214).
- "Domesticity takes shape around the invented ideas of the primitive and the commodity fetish" (217).
