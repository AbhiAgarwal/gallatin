### Quotes

"The timing is significant. War against Iraq, though seemingly imminent, had yet to begin and the faint hope still stirred that it could be stopped. That hope was bolstered by the huge global demonstrations, with a million or so people on the streets of London and Barcelona and impressive numbers recorded in many cities elsewhere throughout the world, including the United States, on 15 February. Sentiment within the Security Council of the United Nations largely supported the view that the threats posed by what everyone agreed was a barbaric and despotic regime could be resolved by diplomatic means. In spite of this opposition, military action against Iraq was initiated at the behest of the United States, supported most conspicuously by Britain and Spain, on 20 March. At the time of writing the outcome of the war, though not in doubt militarily, is still unclear. Will it end up being, or appearing to be, a colonial occupation, a US-imposed clientelist regime, or a genuine liberation?"
