### Class notes

- When you think about issues surrounding "Muslims" and "homosexuals", and view them as separate entities then you are excluding Muslims who are homosexual.
- Who is it possible to "see"? And, why?
- "We judge a world we refuse to know, and our judgment becomes one means of refusing to know that world" (Butler, 156).
