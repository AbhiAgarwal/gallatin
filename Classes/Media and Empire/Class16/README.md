### March 24th:

I found the Nehru speech to be very insightful into the minds of the colonized countries in the mid-20th century. Nehru reflected a lot of the problems that most of the non-major powers had. Most of the countries involved in the conference were directly coming out of being colonized, and so the tone they had was defensive. India was rebuilding its country, national culture, and many other aspects to the country. The more I read Nehru's speech, his reaction from Nehru is completely what I thought India's view on the world would be at that point. They needed to remain strong: "I am dead certain that no country can conquer India. Even the two great power blocs together cannot conquer India; not even the atom or the hydrogen bomb", but neutral: "we do not agree with the communist teachings, we do not agree with the anti-communist teachings".

The opinions that Nehru reflect in this particular piece are somewhat different from the opinions that India seems to reflect now. India is one of the largest importers of weapons, and arms now. I find that interesting to explore as the change in thought from being a country that does not want to participate in war or nuclear warfare to being one of the largest importers is a radical change in opinion. This makes me wonder how opinions of countries change as they start becoming more developed, and the change in their geopolitical standing. This seems like it links very strongly to the idea of development that Julian Go discusses. The idea that the goal of development of these countries was to catch up to the west, and that is what it seems like is happening. At least in national defense and security.
