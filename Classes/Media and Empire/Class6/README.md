Larkin's view that technological ability of the colonizer sets an aim for the country being colonized resonates with me, and is similar to Adas' view on technology. A country being colonized is supposed to be impressed with the technological and political power that the colonizer has, and hand over their nation in hopes of also technologically developing. Larkin writes, "[the] coming of electricity effected a split in Nigeria between electrified and modern towns and those that remained without electric power" (Larkin, 18), and "Grand openings of infrastructure projects like the Kano Water and Electric Light Works are both a visual and spectacle and political ritual... where the public display of colonial authority is made manifest" (Larkin, 19). In Nigeria the British were able to enforce their colonial regime by celebrating the development of Nigeria and reminding the Nigerians how much the British can "help" their country.

This approach links to Adas' view on measuring the worth of man by technology. Adas writes, "European observers came to view science and especially technology as the most objective and unassailable measures of their own civilization's past achievement and present worth" (Adas, 134). By idealistically making the colonized country use this as the measure of their own country, and then helping them increase their self worth they are able to gain political control over the country. Larkin's thoughts and discussion on colonial sublime here is very powerful, he writes "one intent in using infrastructure technologies in colonial rule was to provoke feelings of the sublime not through the grandeur nature but through the work of humankind" (Larkin, 36). The sublime resonated with me a lot since it perfectly described the impression that the everyday person could have on the progress that is being made.
