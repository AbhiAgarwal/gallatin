### Final Papers Due May 14th (8-10 pages)

Due on May 14th by 4:00 PM

### Choices

1. Historical Papers: Your paper would focus on a theme we have covered in a
relevant national/regional location. For example, you could examine in greater
detail the rise of postcolonial film or the role of radio, newspapers or television in
shaping national culture in a specific country, or alternatively within or between
regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America between the 1950s and the 1980s.
Similarly, you could examine in greater detail the role of the US military, the US
state, corporate actors and civil society in engaging with domestic politics in
specific contexts in key period of history between the 1950s and 1980s. Choose
from one of the contexts we have discussed in class: the Philippines, Angola,
South Africa, Indonesia, Pakistan/Afghanistan, Iran, Guatemala, Chile, etc. Here,
you could focus on specific social actors.

2. Contemporary US Empire: Your paper would focus on a theme relating to the ongoing
“War on Terror” that we have discussed in class. For example, you could
examine in greater detail the role of media coverage of particular dimensions of
the war or examine the role of digital media in possibly changing the nature war.
This might mean focusing on the role of US news media versus news media from
other parts of the world (Middle East/South Asia, Europe, etc.) in shaping public
understanding of the invasion of Iraq, or on-going war in Afghanistan/Pakistan
(and beyond), rise of ISIS, etc. You might consider how specific themes we have
discussed in class (humanitarian war, torture, civilian deaths, political
Islam/Islamaphobia, gender/Islam) are framed in specific forms of media—
journalism, social media, video games, film and television. Or you could examine
whether new technologies have changed practices associated with surveillance
and policing developed in earlier eras.

Your paper must draw from at least 4 of the texts we have read over the course of
the second half of the semester and draw from additional relevant research
(including from at least 4 relevant scholarly articles or books on your topic).
