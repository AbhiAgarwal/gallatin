- McCoy, Alfred (2009) Policing America's Empire: The United States, the Philippines and the Rise of the Surveillance State: 206-348.

### Weekly post (250 words) - 9pm

I found two quotations from the ninth chapter incredibly enlightening. McCoy writes in response to President Wilson's "surveillance state", "[after] years of pacifying an overseas empire where race was the frame for perception and control, colonial veterans came home to turn the same lens on America, seeing its ethical communities not as fellow citizens but the internal colonies requiring coercive controls" (McCoy, 294), and "in this process ... the United States ... creates a colony with circumscribed civil liberties and pervasive policing ... as the metropole's internal security apparatus starts to resemble the imperial, so its domestic politics begin to exhibit many attributes of the colonial" (McCoy, 295). These two quotations portray the intensity and impact that the experimentations had on the US. The shift in opinion from viewing them as "ethical communities" to viewing them as "internal colonies" is worth exploring. Earlier in the course we discussed negative and positive freedom, and this further restricts the negative freedom of an individual since they begin living in a more controlled environment. Honestly, I am still wrapping my head around this idea, and I am not too sure how to correctly express the impact on both negative and positive freedom.

The movie was very interesting! I really enjoyed the black and white nature that they portrayed in the film. There were two absolutes that were villains vs heroes. I was intrigued by the connection between the McClintock reading and the movie. I broadly thought that the movie equated to two quotations from McClintock. The movie could have said to be an advertisement to the American people the more americentric view of the world: "advertising's chief contribution to the culture of modernity was the discovery that by manipulating the semiotic space around the commodity, the unconscious as a public space could also be manipulated" (McClintock, 213). And the message in the whole moving being: "a white boy, clothed in a white apron bends benevolently over his "lesser" brother, bestowing upon him the precious talisman of racial progress" (214). This view from McClintock expresses what I believe the American's felt and this idea being a parent that we discussed in class.

### Class notes

- If doing the post: think about the time when the movie was created.
    - How are ideas go from the elites (scientific, military, etc.) to the popular classes? How are they translated and portrayed down the chain? How is difference and knowledge of rational superiority used ...
    - Issues of class and race are at the forefront in the current presidential elections.
- American visual culture: portraying Filipino individuals as either dead or as children. why were they presented that way? presented as either children or as dead enemies (specifically not dead individuals, but enemies)
- how photographs connect to American imperialism
    - photography as a colonial apparatus
    - the image of the Filipino corpse
- stereoscope. image is called stereograph. allowed Victorian to explore the pleasures of empire. through this you could see it, experience it. it was seductive.
    - be transported to the colony
    - middle-class Americans were very drawn to the wars, and even more through stereographs.
    - most Americans formed their opinions of empire through these devices.
    - you have the sense of the 3d effect through a stereoscope.
- American suppressed the number of deaths for many different reasons.
- "Filipino women seeking help from American soldiers" -- an image depicting that.
- Some Black soldiers/journalist/writer were against this idea as it reminded them of the genocide, etc.
- pleasure of empire: seeing the corpse of dead Indians was reassuring. 'we're civilizing the savage'. 'the only good Indian is a dead Indian'.
    - obviously not only one reaction to photographs.
- "I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of ten are" (Theodore, Roosevelt, circa 1886).
    - gets rewarded for saying this by becoming president. became president 15 years after making this statement.
- Kodak company helped build empire.
- Dead Filipino because of ambition of Emilio Aguinaldo. American people advertised him as a dictator. He was not. He was the president of the Philippines.
- [Conant Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Conant_Worcester): best agent of empire.
- school teachers in a lot of schools were soldiers from the army. imagine what it was like to have your school teacher be an individual who killed a lot of your own people, and then comes and offers to teach you.
- docility from sexual savage.
- 1902 -- American media published that the Filipino's were happy with the American rule.
- What is the fascination people have with the female bodies of these colonized countries? Has photography ever been used to tell the truth -- in the context of the Filipino colonization.
    - empire is a gendered logic
- photography used as both the justification and the medium
- there's an amnesia in photography. photography in this medium makes us forget or disillusioned.
