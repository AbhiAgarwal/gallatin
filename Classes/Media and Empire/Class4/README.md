"After Philippine independence in 1946, the national police remained a key instrument of both legal and extralegal presidential power" (McCoy, 16).

One of the important themes in both of the works were that "war transforms technology and industry, so colonialism plays a comparable role for government, producing innovations, particularly in the use of coercive controls, with a profound impact on its bureaucracies both home and abroad ... experiments whose lessons were later repatriated through policies and personnel" (McCoy, 37). This is particularly interesting since it shows the experimental aim that the U.S. might have when it seeks to invade the Philippines. In addition, Mamdani agrees with the theory and writes, "America appears less as exceptional and more as a pioneer in the history and technology of settler colonialism" (Mamdani, 608). In class, we discussed the idea of media as technology and as infrastructure was important. McCoy discussed the use of the national police and how post-independence "remained a key instrument of both legal and extralegal presidential power" (McCoy, 16). The control of both the national police and the media allowed them to selectively govern the political situation in the Philippines. They could control both the wires and the content.
