- Nonetheless, from the 1780s in Britain there was an acceleration in the pace of invention and, perhaps even more critically, an increasing application of new inventions and earlier advances-- in engineering to mineral extraction, manufacturing, and transportation.
- Arthur Young
- European observers came to view science and especially technology as
the most objective and unassailable measures of their own civilization's
past achievement and present worth.
- John Stuart Mill best expressed
the sense of a large majority of the English middle class that machines
had provided the means for the progressive improvement of humanity.
- Some Britons, of course, were a good deal less enthusiastic about the
effects of industrialization: Critics as diverse as Robert Owen and
William Blake, Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Gaskell drew attention to
the pollution of the factory towns and the miserable condition of the
workers whose ranks, particularly in textile mills, included a high proportion
of women and children in the early industrial era.
- Tories is a political party
- distinction between technological accomplishments and
abuses caused' by defects in the political and social systems into which
machines were introduced.
- Smith informs his abject cousin that the technological advances
of the British are "signs that we are, on some points at least, in
harmony with the universe; that there is a mighty spirit working among
us, who cannot be your anarchic and destroying Devil, and therefore
must be the Ordering and Creating God".
- The Germans and
French also solidified the links between science and industrial production
through the establishment of a network of state-supported polytechnical
schools-a pattern that the British adopted only belatedly and
for the most part grudgingly.
- Increasingly industrialized European (and North American) cultures as a
whole were seen to be a separate class, distinct from all others.
- Most nineteenth-century observers mixed nontechnological or nonscientific
gauges-systems of government, ethical codes, treatment of
women, religious practices, and so on-with assessments of African and
Asian material mastery.
- Thus,
unlike earlier gauges by which the Europeans compared societies, those
favored in the nineteenth century were believed to be amenable to empirical
verification and were especially suited to the late Victorian penchant
for "statistical reductiveness.
- Because nineteenth-century Europeans believed that machines, skull
size, or ideas about the configuration of the solar system were culturally
neutral facts, evaluative criteria based on science and technology appeared
to be the least tainted by subjective bias.
- black Africans were incapable of the architectual,
engineering, and stoneworking feats that those who built the great walls
and towers of Zimbabwe had obviously possessed
- Orientalism: is a term used by art historians, literary, geographers, and cultural studies scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in Middle Eastern, South Asian, African and East Asian cultures
- Barrow ridiculed the Chinese for their unbearably arrogant supposition
that foreigners had little to offer the Middle Kingdom. He pointed
out that they had borrowed heavily in both the sciences and technology
in recent centuries. He stressed the role of the Jesuits in transmitting
knowledge and inventions from the West and noted that the emperor
was dependent on them for accurate calendars and clocks and effective
artillery pieces. Barrow saw this dependence as a symptom of China's
general backwardness and evidence o( the degree to which it had fallen
behind the West: "They can be said to be great in trifles, whilst they are
really trifling in everything that is great."
- Each aspired in particular to
acceptance by the intellectual establishment of his respective society.
Each sought acclaim as an authority: Millon India and issues of political
economy more generally; Barrow on China; Le Bon' on a multitude
of subjects from phrenology and mass psychology to India and
Arabia.
- But now they were more
acutely aware of the unprecedented nature of the power and material
wealth that the Europeans' unique scientific and technological advances
had generated. Now they more often saw these advances as the source
of Europe's global dominion, as standards by which to measure the
accomplishments of others against those of Europe, and as prerequisites
for civilized life as they had come to define it.

### Class Notes

- Henry Kissinger
- Science can be hugely influential in every types of change.
- Eugenics: standardize people. There are differences of opinion.
- Capitalism: private ownership of means of production.
    - means of production: factory.
    - free markets.
    - comparative advantage.
        - for Portugal this was cork -- for Britain it was textiles.
    - to gain the comparative advantage you have to go to these "zones of extraction".
        - people go into new markets and, literally, capture them to gain this comparative advantage.
- By century's end,
science and technology had become "mirror-image twins": one oriented
to experiment, theory, and knowing; the other to application, design,
and doing; but both joined in a systematic endeavor to uncover the
secrets and harness the energies of the natural world.
- Blatantly narcissistic
gauges of the worth of non-European peoples-skin color, fashions in
or lack of clothing-receded in importance; measurements of cranial
capacity, estimates of railway mileage, and the capacity for work, discipline,
and marking time became the decisive criteria by which Europeans
judged other cultures and celebrated the superiority of their own.
The fact that these criteria were as culturebound as earlier gauges and
even more loaded in favor of the industrializing West was grasped by
only a handful of intellectuals.
    - these values started to become quantified.
    - the superiority was always there, but now they have a reason why.
- Global Hegemony: hegemony is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others.
    - the way in which power works in the level of ideology.
- Consent of the subordinated.
- Europeans are justifying they are better because they have this technology. Moves from civilization coming from technology.
    - Technology is a determination for how industrialized a country is. Then they use it to measure differences.
- Increasingly industrialized European (and North American) cultures as a
whole were seen to be a separate class, distinct from all others. The
polarities were numerous and obvious: metal versus wood; machine
versus human or animal power; science versus superstition and myth;
synthetic versus organic; progressive versus stagnant. (144).
- Perceived objectivity of science.
    - pre this idea of technology and that as the measure of man: Smith informs his abject cousin that the technological advances
of the British are "signs that we are, on some points at least, in
harmony with the universe; that there is a mighty spirit working among
us, who cannot be your anarchic and destroying Devil, and therefore
must be the Ordering and Creating God.
        - religion was how people measured a society and men in that society
- African/Indian/Chinese societies:
    - India:
        - discussions on how much things have not changed over the last thousand years.
            - Stagnation of Indian technological development.
        - Although Mill had no firsthand experience of India-a fact he noted
proudly because he believed that it heightened his capacity for objectivity-
as preparation for the writing of his six-volume magnum opus
he had spent many years reading whatever works on the subcontinent
were available. (166).
        - He commented explicitly on deficiencies in
Indian science and technology, which he linked to overall defects in
Hindu civilization. He conceded that the Indians had made advances in a
variety cifforms of handicraft manufacture, but like Sonnerat he argued
that these had been achieved in an age long past and that there had been
little improvement in Indian techniques in thousands of years. (167).
        - He argued
that the Indians were ignorant of the natural sciences and that "invention
seems wholly torpid among them." (167).
        - Ward declared categorically that
the Hindus knew "nothing" of anatomy, surgery, chemistry, pharmacy,
physics, and botany; that their geography was "wholly false";
and that they were "very imperfectly acquainted" with mathematics. He
conceded that the Hindus had once made discoveries in astronomy and
had some medical knowledge, but even in these fields, he added, their
knowledge had long since stagnated, and they were centuries behind the
Europeans. (168)
        - "Orientalists, those writers who disagreed
with Mill's contention that India had failed to rise above barbarism to
civilization invariably stressed India's past achievements and contrasted
them with its current backwardness relative to advanced European
state. (173).
    - Africa:
        - Devoid of scientific
            - Unable to create scientific works
        - Africans were seen as biologically close to Europeans past
            - Primitives versions of the Europeans
            - They were not at war with each other. They did not see an internal conflict.
        - Primitive collective: the individual does not speak.
            - The notion of a collective is backwards.
            - The individual as prime, and the collective as pre-modern.
        - Europeans justify these lands as unproductive land.
- Edward Said: Orientalism. Construction of knowledge of the non-west by the west.

Barrow was very intense about his opinions upon the Chinese and the Indians. His view represents the ideal eurocentric way of looking at the world, and one I think represents a lot of how Europe saw civilizations insides its own.
