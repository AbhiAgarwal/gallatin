- Nonetheless, from the 1780s in Britain there was an acceleration in the pace of invention and, perhaps even more critically, an increasing application of new inventions and earlier advances-- in engineering to mineral extraction, manufacturing, and transportation.
- Arthur Young
- European observers came to view science and especially technology as
the most objective and unassailable measures of their own civilization's
past achievement and present worth.
- John Stuart Mill best expressed
the sense of a large majority of the English middle class that machines
had provided the means for the progressive improvement of humanity.
- Some Britons, of course, were a good deal less enthusiastic about the
effects of industrialization: Critics as diverse as Robert Owen and
William Blake, Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Gaskell drew attention to
the pollution of the factory towns and the miserable condition of the
workers whose ranks, particularly in textile mills, included a high proportion
of women and children in the early industrial era.
- Tories is a political party
- distinction between technological accomplishments and
abuses caused' by defects in the political and social systems into which
machines were introduced.
- Smith informs his abject cousin that the technological advances
of the British are "signs that we are, on some points at least, in
harmony with the universe; that there is a mighty spirit working among
us, who cannot be your anarchic and destroying Devil, and therefore
must be the Ordering and Creating God".
- The Germans and
French also solidified the links between science and industrial production
through the establishment of a network of state-supported polytechnical
schools-a pattern that the British adopted only belatedly and
for the most part grudgingly.
- Increasingly industrialized European (and North American) cultures as a
whole were seen to be a separate class, distinct from all others.
- Most nineteenth-century observers mixed nontechnological or nonscientific
gauges-systems of government, ethical codes, treatment of
women, religious practices, and so on-with assessments of African and
Asian material mastery.
- Thus,
unlike earlier gauges by which the Europeans compared societies, those
favored in the nineteenth century were believed to be amenable to empirical
verification and were especially suited to the late Victorian penchant
for "statistical reductiveness.
- Because nineteenth-century Europeans believed that machines, skull
size, or ideas about the configuration of the solar system were culturally
neutral facts, evaluative criteria based on science and technology appeared
to be the least tainted by subjective bias.
- black Africans were incapable of the architectual,
engineering, and stoneworking feats that those who built the great walls
and towers of Zimbabwe had obviously possessed
- Orientalism: is a term used by art historians, literary, geographers, and cultural studies scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in Middle Eastern, South Asian, African and East Asian cultures
- Barrow ridiculed the Chinese for their unbearably arrogant supposition
that foreigners had little to offer the Middle Kingdom. He pointed
out that they had borrowed heavily in both the sciences and technology
in recent centuries. He stressed the role of the Jesuits in transmitting
knowledge and inventions from the West and noted that the emperor
was dependent on them for accurate calendars and clocks and effective
artillery pieces. Barrow saw this dependence as a symptom of China's
general backwardness and evidence o( the degree to which it had fallen
behind the West: "They can be said to be great in trifles, whilst they are
really trifling in everything that is great."
- Each aspired in particular to
acceptance by the intellectual establishment of his respective society.
Each sought acclaim as an authority: Millon India and issues of political
economy more generally; Barrow on China; Le Bon' on a multitude
of subjects from phrenology and mass psychology to India and
Arabia.
- But now they were more
acutely aware of the unprecedented nature of the power and material
wealth that the Europeans' unique scientific and technological advances
had generated. Now they more often saw these advances as the source
of Europe's global dominion, as standards by which to measure the
accomplishments of others against those of Europe, and as prerequisites
for civilized life as they had come to define it.

Barrow was very intense about his opinions upon the Chinese and the Indians. His view represents the ideal eurocentric way of looking at the world, and one I think represents a lot of how Europe saw civilizations insides its own.
