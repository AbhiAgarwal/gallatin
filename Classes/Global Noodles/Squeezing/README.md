Dal baati

Dal is just dried bean (lentil) that has been split. It is a staple in Rajasthan and many other parts of India. It is very simple to make. Usually it is eaten with roti. There many different beans you can make dal with.

Baati is the bread part of the dish: "unleavened bread cooked". Means that it is not made using yeast or any other leavening agent. You take atta (flour) and ghee (clarified butter) (plus some other items) and put it in an oven for it to harden.

Personal knowledge and information gathered from phone calls to India:

- It is made in Rajasthan in many festivals. I did not grow up there, but experienced the meal in many different festival-esque settings whenever I visited.
- Can not recall where I initially ate this dish since it's one of the memorable dishes of my childhood.
- There are many variations of the dish that can be made. It is made differently depending on where you eat it, and what social situation you are attending.
- There are not many places you can find the baati part of the dish.
- Very available in the part of India I grew up in, but has variations in other places in India as well. Usually available in places that have an extreme weather condition: Rajasthan is a desert.
- There is another component to the dish: churma. That is not always available with the dish, and is introduced when eating in a very traditional setting or in a Rajasthani home setting.
    - Churma is a sweet side dish. So it is usually added with the dish when there is something to celebrate. Interesting to explore the variations to dishes particular to each part of Rajasthan.
    - Adding Churma seems to be very global to Rajasthan, and not just a specific variation.

Process of making:

- Lots of different processes. Very hard to pinpoint what people use since it depends on the situation that it is being made for. The dish seems very contextual and very personalized to different people.
- Many people eat Daal baati with more than just the two big components. Sometimes they add yoghurt, or peas, or other types of dal.
- In many parts of Rajasthan they don't use an oven, but they bury it underneath the ground. This hardens the baati very differently. They use the heat from the ground in the day and the coolness of the desert in the night to cook it properly.
- Soldiers used to put do the same process and put the dough underneath the ground. When they returned from their trips they would take them out of the ground and enjoy them with ghee. It is high in calories and very nutritious for the desert weather.

Eating the dish:

- I have experienced the dish in many different situations: festivals, home-made, at dhabas (roadside restaurants in India), restaurants, and at more traditional dinner-parties. It is not something you would get at parties unless you were at a traditional Rajasthani dinner party.
- The filling that people put in the Baati differs a lot between people. So there's always a lot of new ways of experiencing the dish. It never gets old for me since many of my friends and family make it very differently.
- A simple example is the amount of ghee you put: my mom's family soaks it in ghee for about 1 minute. So when you eat it, it is dripping with this clarified butter. It is very soft, and you can feel the ghee in your mouth. This is opposite to how my mom makes it: she puts a table spoon of ghee into each baati rather than dipping it into the ghee. This is because of the health-risks that come about when you soak it in ghee.
- The experience of eating either is very different. They are both very enjoyable since they taste very different. In one you experience this very rich home-made ghee. They also have fresh milk from the farm (rather than in bottles) so they make the ghee at home. The richness in flavor comes out when you make the ghee on the day of. On the other hand, my mom makes excellent dal. So I enjoy the richness of the dal when I eat this dish with my parents.

I am still trying to figure out the origins of the dish. It has been very hard to find proper information on where it came from and how it developed. I have been making calls to see if people understand and know about the history of Baati. Another experiment I want to do is to see why it is the to-go dish in Rajasthani culture -- especially in festivals. Why this particular dish? Is it because everyone loves it? Is it because it is simple to make for good chefs? Is it because it is highly nutritious?

There are some histories of Baati online ([1], [2]), but I'm still looking into whether they are valid sources or not. None of them cite proper information on their sources.
