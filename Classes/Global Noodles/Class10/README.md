Assignment #5: Write a review!

Post your notes on NYU Classes/Forum #5, Sunday 6pm.

After a day of classes, homework, club activities, and battling the cold I ended up lost in Long Island City. What does one do when they are lost in NYC and want to eat noodles? Open up Foursquare! On Foursquare we searched to find a place to have noodles. Foursquare told us that we were near Mu Ramen, a Japanese Restaurant on 1209 Jackson Ave. I am with Phil, a friend, who is also down for some ramen. We start walking towards the restaurant where we encounter a mass of people waiting to get into the restaurant. Given the amount of time we had to wait to get inside, we are both cold and excited to try the food.

The decor of the restaurant is very interesting with the cop and spoons sticks being held by small flowery plates. The food everyone around me was eating seemed very modern and well presented. Lots of veggies, meats, and nabemono pots. From first impressions of walking into the restaurant we both agreed that it was a mix of upscale, modern, and yet traditional.

I wanted to try something different to what I had before so I decided to get the Spicy Miso without the pork. They usually don't have miso soup without pork, but they, very fortunately, had it that day! The waiter/chef staff were incredibly nice to let me alter the item on the menu! It does not happen too often in Japanese restaurants since they make the soups and other elements in batches. I placed my order, and within ten minutes my food comes, which I'm very excited about at this point! The noodles look incredibly red and spicy. I totally forgot that the noodles had Spicy in the name, but I was equally excited since - the spicier the better! This was the first time I didn't need to put extra spice in the noodles. I thought the spice level was pretty perfect, which made the meal even great.
