### A3 - Replicating the taste/smell of “home”

My apologies for being a bit late! I actually managed to have my laptop stop working in San Francisco over the weekend so I had to visit the Apple shop there and get it fixed!

I really missed making dumplings! I used to make them at home in class in Bangkok. My mom used to make it as well, but she used to make a version that I can not replicate. She used to make the filling with Indian spices mixed with soy sauce and vegetables -- it was great! For this, I pulled up a new recipe that I never used before!

I am pairing up with Phil and we made dumplings! Specifically, cabbage and shiitake mushroom dumplings! These are my favorite kinds of dumplings since the flavor reminds me a lot of my childhood. As a vegetarian, there aren't many ingredients that taste great in dumplings (that are also easy to get). The recipe for the dumplings I made are:

- 6 dumping wrappers (I have never made them from scratch)
- 3 ounces shiitake mushrooms
- 2 gloves garlic
- 1 scallion
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 one-inch ginger
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 ounces tatsoi
- 3 ounces cabbage
- Coriander Seed
- Red Chilli
- Cumin Seed
- Turmeric
- Himalayan Herb (Jimbu)
- green curry paste mixed with mushrooms

- Used to make cheese dumplings or a lot of food around milk products

It was pretty fantastic overall. This is mostly my go-to dish when I'm trying to make dumplings. I have not experimented outside of these core ingredients too much (unless it's with my mom). I usually put the butter in with the dumplings to give them a nice glaze on the outside. I don't really know how to make steamed dumplings -- but I would really love to learn how to make those. Took about 30 minutes to make!

The procedure was:

1. Cut the cabbage into thinly sliced leaves. Half the tatsoi. Combine soy sauce and vinegar into a bowl. Slice scallion, peel and mince garlic & ginger.
2. In pan put -- 2 teaspoons of Oil, add mushrooms, and white part of scallion, and cabbage and ginger. Add salt and pepper.
3. Roast the tatsoi with garlic in the oven. Put it on a sheet with oil and salt & pepper.
4. Place dumplings wrappers into bowl of water. Put one tablespoon of filling in each dumpling wrapper, and fold.
5. In pan put -- thin layer of oil. Add dumplings and let cook. Add butter and flip dumplings. Immediately season.
6. Add cooked tatsoi on a plate. Put dumplings on the plate, and sprinkle scallion garnish.

This was a fun experimentation! Had a lot of fun experimenting and the end-product was awesome.
