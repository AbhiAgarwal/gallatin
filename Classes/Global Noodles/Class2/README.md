A1 - #1 What are you range of skill sets?

I was born in Jaipur, India and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. I grew up in an Indian household with parents that regularly eat Indian food. So my taste palate for Indian food is very developed, and I have also traveled around India trying different restaurants, and cuisines. I also ate Thai food on a regular basis for lunch, and so I have a good taste palate for Thai food. I am not a great chief, though. I know how to make very basic Thai and Indian food, but nothing more than that. I have been vegetarian for my whole life, and recently vegan so I have no clue about meats. At home, we regularly tried different cuisines so I am very familiar with Japanese, South Indian, Chinese, Lebanese, Italian food, and somewhat familiar with Mexican, and Greek food. I speak Thai and Hindi fluently, and some Spanish.

I'm also a photographer-in-training, and professionally work as a software developer. So I'd be happy to help if those skills are required.

Tofu, soy sauce,

I am a big big fan of any food that consists of tofu or soy sauce. I can eat that pretty much everyday, but I also love a lot of different foods. That's my basic taste palate, though -- what I am used to eating, and what represents comfort food for me. This wasn't particularly the food I ate everyday, but the food I miss the most when I think of home. That or Indian daals. We never really had sweets at home so I'm not usually drawn towards sweet foods, but more towards salty, sour-ey or spicy food. I also have always been fully vegetarian (now vegan), but it has never really been an issue for me. At home I had my parents to help cook, and New York is also pretty amazing for a vegan. I eat egg, though -- I would never be able to make it without eggs!

In Bangkok, I was able to explore a lot of different cuisines since Bangkok is high on tourism -- tourism usually leads to many different cuisines in a city because of capitalism. I have also traveled through most of Asia, Europe, and Australia. Through this I've been able to explore many different cuisines, and many different preparations of these foods. I have usually found that each cuisine tastes very differently in the respected country it's from when compared to the preparation of that cuisine in many other countries. This can be a good or bad thing since experimentation is usually good, but sometimes the preparation of the cuisine is just not correct.

I don't think there's any type of food I'm drawn away from. But, I dislike a lot of sugars or oils in my food. I'm not a big fan of oily foods, even if they are healthy oils. The taste of oil is a little off-putting. OH - I also love coffee.
