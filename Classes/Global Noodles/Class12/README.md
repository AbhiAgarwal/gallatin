It is a moonless night along the beaches that front the resort hotels of Abu Dhabi. And yet, I struggle to find any darkness at all in the desert itself as I speed across a stretch of the Arabian Peninsula. The land itself remains illuminated with as many foot-candles as crude oil can buy. There are roving spotlights, laser shows dancing across the bay, and blazing digital billboards. I glimpse concert halls and stadiums surrounded by parking lots with metal halide floodlights kept so bright that you could read a newspaper without any visual aids.
