### A4 - Replicating the taste/smell of "home"

deconstructing dumplings

I used this opportunity to try and deconstruct my taste profile while thinking about the dumplings recipe I picked last week. I changed the molded the recipe depending on my own taste profile. I drew this map to depict the places I lived and the foods that influenced my understanding of food from those places the most. Started as I was born vegetarian (basically vegetarian since birth), and being born to an Indian family living in Thailand. Then the different places I lived for either internships or trekking I did around Asia, and the different foods I ate and took back to dishes in Thailand. Finally coming to the US for my education, and how NYC helped me experiment on my own more. I never really thought about the different areas that influenced my understanding of food now, but I found this incredibly helpful to help figure out what I like best.
