### Notes

- Mongols in World Civilization (Mongolia)
    - sheep: provide food - mutton. the environment is very demanding - therefore you need the energy provided by the meat and the fat.
    - horse
    - goat
    - ox
    - yak
    - Mongolia: least densely populated city by far
        - only in the capital city is there a large population
        - their ability to use the horse in warfare was remarkable
        - they have hard winters ok? deal with it (as they did ugh)
            - they lost a shit ton of animals like 30 million shiz
            - some peeps moved out of Mongolia bc of it
            - #nomads can't survive without trade.
            - they never had a "craft" class so they had to import things from China
            - they had to trade with China to import wheat for their noodles
            - second most important diet in the Mongol diet is noodles
            - lunch time is a soup of mutton diet
        - imagine the great walls if u will
        - Chinese helped them organize their government + do census
            - Chinese denied Mongols trade. Mongols came down.
        - Some image of their house. The roof of the house can be opened so in the summer they open the roof and in the winter they close the winter. OK
        - Women were able to own land and animal. They had very progressive rights.
            - however: men made a boot to represent that the women would always be under the boot of the men.
        - Kublai Khan: fifth Khagan (Great Khan) of the Mongol Empire (Ikh Mongol Uls), reigning from 1260 to 1294, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. He also founded the Yuan dynasty in China as a conquest dynasty in 1271, and ruled as the first Yuan emperor until his death in 1294.
            - Gave Macro Polo / his people a passport that said: if you mess with this ambassador you will mess with the Khan.
        - Chinese Porcelain
        - groups that used to live in tents but built some of the most incredible cities such as Beijing.
        - market economy: there used to be a 4 to 1 ratio to goat to sheep. Now there are 1 to 1 so this introduces desertification. the gobi desert is expanding. this is because of the increase demand for cashmere. market economies have a downside when there's no proper rules.
            - the herding economy is dying. herders need a government. with the new market economy stuff the government was told not to help with the market. it used to be a communist government. in a communist government structure there was a free hospital structure, boarding school, trucks, etc. western advisors dismantled a lot of things, which made the herding population low. the living conditions are much worse off.
            - increasing violence in the long term.
            - someone is making a lot of money off of the cashmere, but the herders are not.
