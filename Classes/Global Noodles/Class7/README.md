Abstract:

The curry leaf opens up the flavours of the vast reaches of the eastern Indian Ocean that not only hints at long-established transactions in taste and comestibles that pre-date European empires of trade that have been vastly underestimated by Eurocentric history writing, but also points to the promising future of the Indian Ocean cultural region in the current conjuncture. Among staid dishes such as lamb curry with coriander and garam masala and mixed raita, chef Suvir Saran springs the fiery 'South Indian-Style chicken with Curry Leaves and Black Peppercorns' in his gorgeous book titled Indian Home Cooking. In particular, the curry leaf (L. Murraya koenigii) brings us tantalisingly close to the edge of the Indian sub-continent. Curry leaves are closely associated with peninsular India. We also find it in Cambodia, where the Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roast it to a crunch, crushing it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. According to the Indonesian chef William Wongso, the closest substitute to the daun salam leaf (L. syzygium polyantha) used in Indonesian dishes, such as Spicy Minced Beef in Banana Leaf Packets and the Central Javanese Beef Soup (Taoto), is the curry leaf. It is used in Burmese cooking and called pyinaw- thein and in Malay daun kari or karupillay.

Cumin, Camels, and Caravans: A Spice Odyssey

One piece of historical understanding and something I couldn't put into place was the reading when they described the greek term aromakitos. The term and the history of the sense of smell helped to understanding why they are so closely linked together. It's pretty obvious that smell and the taste of food are both important, but I'm interested in how people started to figure out the connections. Why the smell of something leads to the increase of happiness or in the healing process of individuals. I'm still curious to figure out if it's something that we've always kind of figured out in a sense that we always have known that the taste enhances the food or was it some kind of realization that happened when we connected the two senses together. Perhaps it's linked to when we started to create food for the taste rather for survival. In the book they described and talked about the dessert plants and how the dessert plants and their aroma along with spices that grew there were made into foods that helped the people there start to realize the importance of smell and taste in foods.
