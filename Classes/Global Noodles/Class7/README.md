Abstract:

The curry leaf opens up the flavours of the vast reaches of the eastern Indian Ocean that not only hints at long-established transactions in taste and comestibles that pre-date European empires of trade that have been vastly underestimated by Eurocentric history writing, but also points to the promising future of the Indian Ocean cultural region in the current conjuncture. Among staid dishes such as lamb curry with coriander and garam masala and mixed raita, chef Suvir Saran springs the fiery 'South Indian-Style chicken with Curry Leaves and Black Peppercorns' in his gorgeous book titled Indian Home Cooking. In particular, the curry leaf (L. Murraya koenigii) brings us tantalisingly close to the edge of the Indian sub-continent. Curry leaves are closely associated with peninsular India. We also find it in Cambodia, where the Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roast it to a crunch, crushing it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. According to the Indonesian chef William Wongso, the closest substitute to the daun salam leaf (L. syzygium polyantha) used in Indonesian dishes, such as Spicy Minced Beef in Banana Leaf Packets and the Central Javanese Beef Soup (Taoto), is the curry leaf. It is used in Burmese cooking and called pyinaw- thein and in Malay daun kari or karupillay.
