Assignment #2: What's at your local market?

A: When you go to your local supermarket, what do you see? How is the food arranged? What aisles do you walk down? How does that influence what you buy? For Part I of this assignment we would like for you to meet with a partner from class and take a day trip to two different food markets. For instance, you can wander in the East Village and go to Sunrise Mart on Stuyvesant Street, and then walk down to the Whole Foods on Houston. Or perhaps you may wish to go to the Hong Kong Supermarket in Brooklyn and then go to a C-Town Supermarket in Brooklyn? Regardless of which two markets you choose, treat each market visit as an ethnographic expedition. What do you immediately see when you walk into the store? How is the food ordered in the store? What is the geography of the space?

Go to the “noodles” and “dumpling” related sections including what you’d use for sauces and ingredients. Is this search convenient? Scattered? How so?

B: Bodegas are considered a main feature of New York’s cityscape. Although the term “bodega” is the Spanish word for “warehouse,” it is also a name that frequently refers to a corner store with a very specific store design. What is that specific store design and what is the store design of your own neighborhood bodega? For this part of the assignment we would like for you to go to the local bodega in your neighborhood. What does it look like from the outside? What are the food products that are sold? What other types of merchandise are sold? Is there a resident cat? Finally, how does your bodega reflect the neighborhood? Do you see the effects of gentrification on the shelves?

Again, look for noodles, dumplings, and ingredients you’d want to use. Is this search convenient? Scattered? How so?

C: Lab – Cognitive mapping. Ultimately, the collaboratory is about making delicious flavors. Passive consuming w/o knowing how to create the flavors simply isn’t good enough! In your kitchen or lab space, start reproducing the taste profiles that have represented “home.” And begin getting at the essence of what it is you love now. Reflect on this shift and on the continuities. Start drawing this out on a blank sheet of paper.
