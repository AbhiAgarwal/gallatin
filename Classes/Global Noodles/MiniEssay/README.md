### Questions

I grew up with Dal Baati.

1. Why is Dal Bati very culturally significant? How did the dish evolve culturally and economically? What were the different types of people in the city who were responsible to eat this dish?
2. Unaffected or affected by the British colonization of the dish?
3. The filling that people put in the Baati differs a lot between people. So there's always a lot of new ways of experiencing the dish. It never gets old for me since many of my friends and family make it very differently.
4. Experience with attempting to understand the history of this dish. Making phone calls to people to try and understand since a lot of the history is not well documented.
5. Why was it initially made and what different cultures in India influence it? Who were the people who used to eat it in the past?
6. India used to have Kings rather than democratic parties -- and this dish is from that time.
7. The history of lentils and how these types of beans became important in Indian history. Is it for nutrition or because of their availability?
8. This is very different from the other Rajasthani food and other types of Indian food. How did the Indian cuisine develop so differently to the neighboring states in the country? How did its history of being colonized affect India and by extension Rajasthani cuisine.
9. There aren't many hard bread objects in India cuisine. Most of them are soft breads.
10. There's a lack of these dishes in NYC. Why is that? It's a delicious dish.
11. Variations is important to understand: how did the culture in different parts of the state evolve with the food? There's a clear distinction that we can draw from because the dishes evolved depending on availability of resources, and need. Hotter and farm land places had different variations. Super interesting to understand.
12. Still trying to figure out the visual resources I can use for the dish.
