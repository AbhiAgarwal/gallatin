Post your second review on NYU Classes/Forum #5, Friday March 11 6pm. & send your self-evaluation via email to Jack & Julia

1. The second review is to further expand your explorations. As we’ll discuss Thursday, stuffed breads, roti, and dumplings are all included in your realms of possible tastings and as potential picks for your artifact. Get out into the boros where these foodways thrive and don’t just go to the places where NYU students habituate. (I’m sorry Vanessa’s Dumplings chain should not meet the grade!) For example try Lam Zhou instead. Lam Zhou is located at 144 East Broadway between Pike Street and East Broadway in Chinatown to get a feel of a more real Chinese local dumpling place more similar to what is found in Shanghai—a simple local place not catering to tourists nor students. If you’re not used to entering an other than Anglo-American place, relax and just say its your first time there and ask how to order.
2. Take a look at this academic discussion Powell “Making Sense of Place: Mapping as a Multisensory Research Method,” 2010. The heart of it begins w/Ken and the three others student researchers mapping Chorrillo, Panama. (543-53) This offers a sense of how you can fulfill the mapping assignment due next week.

3. Midterm self-evaluation: NYU asks faculty to give midterm grades. As you know I believe in critical self-evaluations and now need you to provide me with your assessment to help me make understand how you’re doing and to make adjustments. I believe in honest effort and being self-aware of what you’re learning, what you want to learn, etc. I need your responses by Friday 3.11 night. Those who don’t send their self-evals will get an automatic posting of a C.

Midterm questions: (email responses to both: Jack.Tchen@nyu.edu & jm4249@nyu.edu )

- Basic accounting: Have you attended all classes except when not feeling well or for a family emergency? Have you been keeping up with the readings? Postings? Participating?
- Go back over your notes for the semester thus far. Think back to what you entered the class thinking and writing and saying and compare to now in the middle of the term. Critically evaluate what you’ve learned from readings, class discussions, and your own research and writing. Nothing fluffy! Think about both the content of what you’ve learned and the research skills you’ve picked up. Please be detailed and specific.
- Discuss your most important insights.
- How much have you pushed yourself?
- Do you feel that you have challenged your comfort level and explored cuisines that are unfamiliar? 
- What have you learned about historical research so far?
- How do you want to focus the second half?
- What grade would you give yourself?
- What suggestions do have for the second half?
