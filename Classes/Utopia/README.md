Description
In the sixteenth century, Thomas More, inspired by Plato’s Republic,  imagined his own ideal state. Instead of Eutopia,  which means ‘happy place,’ More ironically named his imaginary island Utopia , which means simply ‘no place.’ More’s influential book eventually lent its name to a diverse set of texts and visions. The concept of utopia now carries both meanings and embodies the logical and ethical tensions that plague metaphorical (and sometimes geographical) borderlands between the ideal and the real. In the 20th century authors and theorists began to seriously weigh the benefits and dangers of utopian thought, as feminists, Marxists, environmentalists, and cosmopolitans continued to imagine new and complex utopias. In this course, we will examine the long tradition of utopian writing and thinking, analyzing its aesthetics and logic, uncovering and assessing its recurring themes and assumptions, and evaluating its utility and ethics. Students will write and revise four essays, each of which emphasizes a particular analytic strategy. Readings may include work by Plato, Augustine of Hippo, Thomas More, Edward Bellamy, Ernest Callenbach, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Frederic Jameson, Karl Popper, Krishan Kumar, B.F. Skinner, and George Orwell.
