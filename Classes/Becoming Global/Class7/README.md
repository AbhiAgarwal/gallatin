"Heroic" Explorations and Colliding Worlds

- Hakluyt, “Discovery of the large, rich, and beautiful Empire of Guiana. . . by Sir Walter Raleigh” (1595)
- Taylor, “Hamlet in Africa 1607”

### Notes

- Hamlet in Africa:
    - investigates how one of Shakespeare’s most popular works found its way onto African soil almost two and a half centuries before any known performance of Hamlet in the New World.
    - Performed aboard the English merchant ship The Red Dragon in 1607 Sierra Leone, Hamlet became a gesture of mutual trust and multicultural exchange between the sailors and natives, as the English actor-sailors gifted European culture to the region and the audience of Sierra Leoneans offered acceptance and attention to the foreign performers.
    - Comparing the social and political structures found in Hamlet to those of Sierra Leone in 1607, Taylor mostly focuses on how the Sierra Leoneans would have received and reacted to the English sailors’ performance of this Shakespeare play.
    - However, I am still left wondering how Sierra Leoneans have impacted the content of Hamlet or its cultural legacy overtime. Did any of the cultural values or traditions of the region embed in the sailors future performances or proliferation of the play?

- The first very interesting point that Taylor made was stating that Hamlet was a “…prototype of English cultural imperialism.”
- Hamlet was (perhaps unintentionally at first) a way to demonstrate England’s cultural power and by taking the play and performing it abroad, the extent of England’s exploration and globalization is demonstrated
- Why was reading the play aloud and subsequently performing it so important, especially if it was not totally politically correct to do so? William Keeling, the captain, is the reason the performance is known at all, but interestingly in his journals he felt he had to justify it
- ** A final point that particularly interested me was the importance of having an audience as opposed to simply performing for others on the ship
    - This was twofold, both offering “the English an opportunity and excuse to perform” while at the same time “to increase affection” between the Africans and Europeans
- What stuck out to me was how accepting Keeling was towards Lucas Fernandez, but then how he back pedals and feels he has to defend himself. He brings up many examples to show why they had taken him aboard even though he was a “negere”, including: he spoke almost perfect Portuguese and could “interpret”, he was a Catholic, literate and a favorite of the king which was very important
