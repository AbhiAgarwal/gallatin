### Class writing

The obsessive nature of documenting travel was very intriguing to me. It seemed like a motivation for people to travel was to get published or mentioned or have their experience documented in some way. Everyone seemed to believe that they were traveling the world and discovering the world -- for everyone not just the Europeans, which again shows the eurocentric view of history and how it is written. In the reading "Voyages of Francis Drake about the whole world", it clearly seems like they imagined that they were the dominant civilization in the world and others were just "dogs". Another reason for traveling was to discover or strike gold, gems, or any type of natural resource. This wasn't very apparent in the logs they wrote (for obvious reasons I think), but in the Sherman reading. In addition, I was also surprised about how straightforward Thomas Cavendish was in his logs, "our general landed with 70 men or thereabout, and went up to their town, where we burnt 2 or 3 houses" (Cavendish, 276). It reinforced the idea that they saw the rest of the world differently. Moreover, I also definitely agree with Luke on understanding, and questioning these kinds of writings and biases they may have before making judgments.
