### Class writing

The obsessive nature of documenting travel was very intriguing to me. It seemed like a motivation for people to travel was to get published or mentioned or have their experience documented in some way. Everyone seemed to believe that they were traveling the world and discovering the world -- for everyone not just the Europeans, which again shows the eurocentric view of history and how it is written. In the reading "Voyages of Francis Drake about the whole world", it clearly seems like they imagined that they were the dominant civilization in the world and others were just "dogs". Another reason for traveling was to discover or strike gold, gems, or any type of natural resource. This wasn't very apparent in the logs they wrote (for obvious reasons I think), but in the Sherman reading. In addition, I was also surprised about how straightforward Thomas Cavendish was in his logs, "our general landed with 70 men or thereabout, and went up to their town, where we burnt 2 or 3 houses" (Cavendish, 276). It reinforced the idea that they saw the rest of the world differently. Moreover, I also definitely agree with Luke on understanding, and questioning these kinds of writings and biases they may have before making judgments.

### Notes

- group discussion posts:
    - a lot of it was rhetoric to create this idea of English glory
    - differences between Drake and Cavendish: Drake was a little less about killing and more about trading, and Cavendish was more about killing and more towards pointing out that the other countries were savages.
    - Drake: more towards monarchs and employers. we were nice and we gave them clothes. we have their best interest at heart.
    - Cavendish: monarchs.
    - main differences:
        - differences in tone
    - main similarities:
        - rhetoric since they're both diaries
    - burnt a Church. Church was for Spanish Christianity.
- Columbus:
    - he partially thought he was in paradise. what marks paradise? biblically eden. safe, abundance.
    - how do you think without knowledge?
    - pilgrimage: you go & you come back. some sense of religious understanding. it's the site of sacred. why do people go to these places? materialization of the sacred or holy. some historically important place. when you're different then you're back. your soul has a better place. you come back restored or refreshed. more spiritual.
    - there are parts of the world which mean different things to different people. Paris for art & history, India for some kind of spiritual journey. the separation between country and city is also very interesting to explore. it shows how little people understand about India. what cities in India are more religious? just being in India is a spiritual journey? what about all of France?

- Drake
    - talks a lot about expansions, and the native tribes in Africa being natural slaves. the tone is somewhat that this is somewhere that can be expanded to.
- Spain
    - divisions in Spain. in Spain there are currently Kingdom.
    - piracy was an essential part of warfare. the victory over other ships was to take its goods.
    - there was a free for all in the ocean.
    - English: lets steal from the Spanish because they have access to material and goods that we don't.
- English
    - East India company
- Let's a culture of piracy that develops in the 17/18th century. Ship require a certain type of governance and a community. Pirate ships become more democratic spaces than other spices. author: Marcus Rediker.
    - q: can you own the sea as well? it's fluid. what does it mean to own water?
- British to try and set the Spanish as oppressors.
- They were on the high seas playing from behind.
    - Guerrilla tactics.
- future research topics:
    - relationship of england with catholic church
- you can't split Spain the enemy who is rich, and Spain the enemy who is catholic.
- English are more merchant-oriented.
- Audience becomes really important in the readings.
- Sir Francis Drake becomes important in the future. There are concerns about Drake coming.
- why do we move to trade empire to colonization (barrel and guns):
    - the British empire could have gotten a lot from the countries in their trade empire.
    - there's never a complete shift from one to the other. both colonization and trade empire are happening at the same time depending on the natives in each country.
    - some of it is about extracting resources or labor, and then the other is about land colonialism.
    - their way of thinking about it in the new world was very different. it was very different from expanding territory close to home. it's about having employment, religious regions.
    - 1601 -- letter that goes to the east indies.
- how important techniques of representing are in these texts. the ways people wrote about these texts was important in the development of what people thought about the world.
