### Quotes

"Ligon's narrative is a microcosm of a much larger ideological maneuver that juxtaposed the familiar with the unfamiliar-the beautiful woman who is also the monstrous laboring beast. As the tenacious and historically deep roots of racialist ideology become more evident, it becomes clear also that, through the rubric of monstrously "raced" Amerindian and African women, Europeans found a means to articulate shifting perceptions of themselves as religiously, culturally, and phenotypically superior to those black or brown persons they sought to define" (Morgan, 168).

"Travel accounts produced in Europe and available in England provided a corpus from which subsequent writers borrowed freely, reproducing images of Native American and African women that resonated with readers. These travelers learned to dismiss the idea that women in the Americas and Africa might be innocuous, unremarkable, or even beautiful" (Morgan, 169).

"The passage conveys admiration for indigenous women's strength in pregnancy and their ability to maintain aesthetically pleasing bodies, and it also represents the conflict at the heart of European discourse on gender and difference" (Morgan, 171).

"In a passage that closely follows, MUnster considered another role for indigenous women and children, a role whose proximate contradiction evokes the complicated nature of European assessment of women and their bodies. Describing the behavior of so-called cannibals, Miinster avowed that "such children as they take, they geld to make them fat as we doo cocke chikyns and younge hogges. . . Such younge women as they take, they keepe for increase, as we doo hennes to laye egges."'8 The metaphor of domesticated livestock introduced a notion that became an idee' fixe concerning indigenous and enslaved women's twofold value to the European project of expansion and extraction" (Morgan, 172).

"Although cannibalism was not exem- plified by women only, women with long breasts marked such savagery among Native Americans for English readers" (Morgan, 176).

"African women's African-ness seemed contingent on the linkages between sexuality and a savagery that fitted them for both productive and reproductive labor" (Morgan, 184).
