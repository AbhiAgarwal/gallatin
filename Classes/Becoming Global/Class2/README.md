- Writing assignment: What are the connotations of the terms “globe” and “globalization”? How is a globalized world different from a world that is not globalized? What enables globalization or is necessary to it? What are some of the possible advantages or benefits of globalization? What are some of the problems that globalization produces?
- After your complete the above, read the short excerpts on NYU Classes. How do these early modern authors envision their world as globalized? How do they engage with the issues you wrote about? How does their early modern global consciousness seem different from, or similar to, our contemporary one?
