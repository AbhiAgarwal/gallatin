From Encounter to Conquest: Global Dominations

- Visual Representations of the New World

Discovery of America initially depicts the fully clothed European man and him encountering the naked American Indian female, who is greeting him with her empty hand welcoming him to her land. This is juxtaposed by the European man whose hands are completely full. In one of his hands he has a crucifix and in the other he has a staff. The crucifix symbolizes religion, tradition, and faith, and the staff usually symbolizes knowledge, wealth, and wisdom. He can be said to be bringing both of these to the new land, and the American Indian is welcoming him with open arms, perhaps, in seeking to learn his ways. His armor also symbolizes progress.

The scene in the foreground is very different to the scene in the background. In the background the American Indians are eating human flesh. This contrasts the powerful and profound interaction that is happening in the foreground. It seems like Straet wanted to show the aspect of discovery and progress vs backwards and savageness. Perhaps to justify the invasion of the boats. The women inviting him could also be the eurocentric view that she (American Indians) wanted the help of the Europeans. Moreover, it's hard to me to comment on the image itself since the author is portraying this from a very eurocentric perspective. This image is a very idealistic depiction of the Discovery of America, and in reality there was a lot of bloodshed. The question is -- why is the painter attempting to add this layer of peace on top of it?
