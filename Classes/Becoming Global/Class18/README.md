In An Antique Land

- hamlet: a small settlement, generally one smaller than a village.

The best advise for reading this book is to keep a list of characters, create a time-line, and keep a map when reading the book. I am glad I got this advise in class as it helped me get into the book properly, and I agree with Meagan on the confusion at the beginning. I really enjoy Ghosh's writing style.

Similar to Adam, I found the cultural conflict between Imam and Ghosh very relevant to conversations I have with students and people around NYC. The nationalistic and prideful tone that Imam was unexpected to me, and his opinions and attitudes towards the west make them seem superior to any other area of the world. His attitudes towards the west feel like a post-colonist view of the world. The criteria he uses for advancements in a society are also worth exploring. He first points out that people in India "[burns] their dead", and questions Ghosh, "[why] do you allow it? Are you savages that you permit something like that? Look at you: you've had some education; you should know better. How will your country ever progress if you carry on doing these things?". This type of mentality is similar to the depictions of the Native Indians in the Americas when they were discovered. Painting the continent of India as being backwards by burning its people rather than burying them.

Second, it was interesting to see him deny and strongly oppose the idea of India having weapons. It was uncertain to me why he would think that, but it seems like there was some control over the media and books that were being sold in Egypt. Here, Ghosh says something that I took a lot away from: "Imam and I: delegates from two superseded civilizations, vying with each other to establish a prior claim to the technology of modern violence".
