Question I want to explore: How were the Native Indians in the Americas depicted when they were first found by the Europeans?
Source: Credo, Blackwell Companions to American History: A Companion to American Indian History

On Credo I used the query: "Native AND Indians, AND depicted, AND Europeans". This gave me about 286 results, and by filtering into particular subjects I was able to get it down to a little less than a hundred. I found two reference entries I found interesting: "European and Native American Alliances" [1] and "Indians and Christianity" [2]. Both of these entries looked pretty amazing and useful for my source, but I found the "Indians and Christianity" to be much more dense and it also had a larger bibliography, which is useful to find other sources.

Willard Hughes Rollings, the author, was of Cherokee descent. It seems very interesting to see the account of an individual who was professor and scholar of Native American history write on the religious aspect of the colonization. The piece seemed like a very interesting overview on both the historical facts and the overview of the new material that is coming out. Rollings writes "while scholars continue to struggle to make sense of the fragments of Indian visions and voices from the past, they need not struggle to understand the present. For Native Americans are writing and speaking, and all scholars have to do is pay attention".
