### Mar. 3:

- Finish Reading The Tempest

The Act 1 of the Tempest, during the storm, made the class distinctions between the different individuals very clear. The wealthy royals, mostly panicked, relied on the boatswain and the laborers to save the ship, and them. The division is seem very clearly within the first couple scenes, and is a division most of us (as readers reading back) are very familiar with. The discussions turn from being about the ship and fixing the situation at hand to more about class distinctions and the conflict that lies there. The initial class distinction that is created is in the first couple seconds of the play when Gonzalo says "Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard" (98), and the opposition can be seen when Boatswain says "None that I more love than myself" (98).

In Act 2 we understand the further abstraction and see the man in control of the situation. There's a layer of the scene we don't recognize and don't realize who is clearly in power at any point until it was reveled. Caliban is shown and treated by the characters as being lesser or inferior. He protests and opposes against Prospero, which can signify the power of the colonist, and Caliban at one point says "I must eat my dinner, This island's mine by Sycorax my mother, Which thou tak'st from me. When thou cam'st first, Thou strok'st me and made much of me; wouldst give me Water with berries in't ..." (119). This is an interesting quote as it describes the feelings of the nation being colonized.
