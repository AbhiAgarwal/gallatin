- Mintz, Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History (from the last paragraph on page xviii through page 96)

### Notes

Mintz -- he is an anthropologist and has personal experience working in and around Caribbean sugar plantations

"Basically, Mintz uses this production and consumption to tie various parts of the world together and tell a global history of British industrialization".

"Sugar plantations were a "synthesis of field and factory" - sugar production involved interchangeable workers, operating in a time-conscious atmosphere".

"Sugar from the West Indies combined with tea from East Asia to become a calorie rich stimulant that workers could afford on the lowest of wages. Exploited labor on sugar plantations thus "sharply reduced the overall cost of creating and reproducing the metropolitan proletariat." So, labor and class, and tea and sugar, and the changing meanings of consumables. All very interesting. Made me want tea and scones, and I made do with tea and girl scout cookies."

"The map-like understanding of where sugar came from and went is valuable, although not as much as it could have been if coupled with an understanding of why it moved from place to place"

"Divides the uses of sugar into five types: medicine, spice-condiment, decorative, sweetener, and preservative."

“it (sugar) is closely connected to England’s fundamental transformation from a hierarchical, status-based, medieval society to a social-democratic, capitalist, and industrial society” while entirely neglecting to explain how it is connected to the transformation (185).

“There grew up, in effect, two so-called triangles of trade, both of which arose in the seventeenth century and matured in the eighteenth. The first and most famous triangle linked Britain to Africa and to the New World: finished goods were sold to Africa, African slaves to the Americas, and American tropical commodities (especially sugar) to the mother country and her importing neighbors. The second triangle functioned in a manner contradictory to the mercantilist ideal. From New England went rum to Africa, whence slaves to the West Indies, whence molasses back to New England (with which to make rum). The maturation of this second triangle put the New England colonies on a political collision course with Britain, but the underlying problems were economic, taking on political import precisely because they brought divergent economic interests into confrontation.” (43)

That he can baldly assert that the changes to modern eating habits are indicative of "the extent to which we have surrendered our autonomy over our food" (211) reveals only the extent to which his entire argument must be treated skeptically, glazed as it is in a saccharine Marxist anti-modernism, even Luddism.

### Essay

The first three sections of the book were important in understanding the full history of sugar and the influences of sugar in the different parts of the world. I found the uses of sugar that the author listed to be particularly interesting: preservative, spice-condiment, decorative, medicinal, and as a sweetener. Sugar is usually nowadays placed into one particular bucket: sweetener. The interesting thing is how many different roles it played, and this book was particularly helpful in recognizing that role. The role it plays socioeconomically, culturally, and the analysis the author does on the macroeconomic level that sugar plays links to that as well.

My favorite quotation from this particular essay is on page 43 where the author describes the "two so-called triangles of trade". Mintz writes, "the first and most famous triangle linked Britain to Africa and to the New World: finished goods were sold to Africa, African slaves to the Americas, and American tropical commodities (especially sugar) to the mother country and her importing neighbors ... The maturation of this second triangle put the New England colonies on a political collision course with Britain, but the underlying problems were economic, taking on political import precisely because they brought divergent economic interests into confrontation." (43). The last portion of this quotation discusses why they were looking to diversity their economic interests in the first place, but summarized.

In addition, I am also curious by the question posed by Dylan. They are comfortable taking and learning from the aesthetic of sugar, but not the technical contributions that foreign nations have made.
