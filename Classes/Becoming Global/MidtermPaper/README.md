### Midterm [Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ogDXbbRg711fjH8Aj-KW77vBYJqkxhfOvRJL-GwBSoQ/edit)

1500-2000 words (not including the cover note). Please double-space the paper, using a standard 12 point font and one inch margins.

1) Analyze the representational techniques the work(s) you are analyzing use to produce or contribute to the development of a form of global consciousness.

- For example, you might discuss the use of the globe itself (in visual images or as an object itself), the use of classical or mythical references in visual or written materials, the use of spectacle, or the blending of fact and fiction in travel narratives. You are not limited to these choices; these are only some suggestions.

But I would recommend focusing on only one technique (or perhaps a related set of techniques) so that you can explore it in depth.

1. In what ways is this technique useful for representing new information, new (national) objectives, or a change in social relations as a result of an increasingly global world?
2. In what ways does this technique actually contribute to a new way, or new ways, of thinking about the world or these social relationships?
3. To what extent does the use of these representational techniques require an act of interpretation or translation?
4. What is lost or left unrecognized through this act of mediation, translation, or interpretation?

This topic while narrow in its focus on representational techniques also gives you a lot of room for choice: of the technique, of the text, and of the issues it helps to negotiate or translate. Just as I would recommend focusing on one or a set of related texts, I would also recommend focusing on one issue or a related set of issues.

The third objective is to provide you with an opportunity to reflect carefully on the ways that global consciousness is developing in the early modern period. As you’ll see all three rubrics point you in that direction through some of the sub –questions.

- Global consciousness might be the primary focus of your essay, depending on your topic and how you choose to approach it. But I would like each of you to dedicate at least part of your essay to thinking about how global consciousness is developing and what it is.
- Here are some questions to help you think about this larger question:

1. How are ideas about the globe or globalization developing in the work you are exploring?
2. How do nations, writers, explorers or individuals see themselves as part of a global world?
3. How do they help to produce a global world? How is a global world materially different from one which is not?
3. In some sense, this objective asks you to think about how the “bigger picture” is transformed by the specific issue you are exploring in depth. It could be something you do in the concluding section of your essay, or it might be woven throughout. For some of you, it will be the primary focus.
