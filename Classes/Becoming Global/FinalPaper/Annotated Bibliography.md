Question I want to explore: How were the Native Indians depicted when they were first found by the Europeans?

Dippie, Brian W. "The Moving Finger Writes: Western Art and the Dynamics of Change." Prown, Jules David. Discovered Lands, Invented Pasts: Transforming Visions of the American West. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press and Yale University Art Gallery, 1992.

The text above provides a historical account of how European-Americans have adapted and defined themselves through ideas, images, and clothing of the Native Indian. It would be interesting to explore the Native Indian ideologies through the European-Americans, and what aspects of their culture they actually adopted. Looking at what they adopted also helps us understand how they perceived their culture.

In addition, to utilize the book "The White Man's Indian: Images of the American Indian from Columbus to the Present" to further gain information on this topic.
