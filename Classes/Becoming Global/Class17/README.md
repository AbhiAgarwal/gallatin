"Amitav Ghosh said he learned to write fiction by means of the process of keeping two notebooks of observations during his fieldwork in Egypt. He spoke to a class of mine a few years ago and answered some question about the value of writing programs, saying that his anthropological field work was all the training in creative writing that he ever had.

- One set of notes were for the official work he was doing, the doctoral thesis research; the other was personal, commentary on the struggles to make sense of things, but also overflowing with the material unsuited for the anthropology he was doing.
- Ghosh said that the tension between these two notebooks made him realize some important lesson about writing generally.
- I think it is fair to say that In an Antique Land is in some ways simply a record of that learning process for Ghosh, among other things.

You notice, as you read it, both the highly personal search into history he is doing—intimate historiography, in a sense—which also contains very sophisticated critiques of Western historiography.  At the same time Ghosh reveals his findings about the relatively unimportant (or a-historical) Hindu slave, he also revels in the casual demolition of the process of making history his search for Bomma yields. There is a link between these two processes: the learning of one trade (writing fiction) while practicing another; and the subversive search for an anonymous unremarkable historical figure.  The link is that Ghosh’s writing yields subsidiary pleasures.  By breaking down barriers between genres, Ghosh is not simply attacking the boundaries, or trying to destroy the power structures inherent in genre boundaries.  He is seeking a more honest and accurate way of telling.  Books ought to create their own structure out of the material they are made of."

Amitav, a young Indian anthropologist from Oxford, conducting ethnographic fieldwork in an Egyptian  village (the character bears obvious similarities to the auth or, but is never explicitly  identified with him).
- Secondly, the story of a 12th century Jewish merchant, Abraham, Ben Yiju, and his slave.
- Their lives were reconstructed by Amitav using fragments of letters found in an Egyptian synagogue—Ben Yiju, a Tunisian Jew, lived in Egypt for many years before moving to India, where he probably hired his slave, Bomma, who acted as an assistant, traveling and negotiating large trades for Ben Yiju.
- The primary concerns of subaltern studies and postcolonial theory emerge naturally from Ghosh’s narrative: he articulates the strained relationship between Egypt and India which, although very different countries, share a history of colonial violence and a desire for modernization.  He fleshes out the networks of exchange which have circulated between Egypt and India (and throughout the rest of the Mediterranean and the Near East), describing in great detail the money, goods, and people which were traded between India and Egypt in the Middle Ages as in the twentieth century.  Ghosh is also careful to examine the less visible exchanges which have linked Egypt and India throughout history—namely, etymological, cultural, and religious ones.
