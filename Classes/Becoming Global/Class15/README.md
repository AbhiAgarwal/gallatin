FILM TITLE: Tambien La Lluvia

DIRECTORS: Icíar Bollaín

DATE OF VIEWING: March 21st 2016.

LOCATIONS. PLEASE BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE:

- Year 2000: Cochabamba, Bolivia.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:

- The restoration of civilian rule to Bolivia in 1982 ended decades of military dictatorships, but did not bring economic stability. In 1985, with hyperinflation at an annual rate of 25 thousand percent, few foreign investors would do business in the country.
- The Bolivian government turned to the World Bank as a last refuge against economic meltdown. For the next 20 years, successive governments followed the World Bank's provisions in order to qualify for continued loans from the organization.
- In order to move towards independent development, Bolivia privatised its railways, telephone system, national airlines, and hydrocarbon industry. In October 1999, the privatization of Cochabamba's municipal water supply followed, allowed by a new law and the investment of a new firm, Aguas del Tunari – a joint venture involving San Francisco-based Bechtel Corporation –. The agreement involved the firm investing in a long-envisioned dam so they dramatically raised water rates.
- Protests, largely organized through the Coordinadora in Defense of Water and Life, a community coalition, erupted in January, February, and April 2000, culminating in tens of thousands marching downtown and battling police. In April 2000, the national government reached an agreement with the Coordinadora to reverse the privatization. The wave of demonstrations and police violence was described as a public uprising against water prices.
- The Cochabamba protests of 2000, also known as the Cochabamba Water War or the Water War in Bolivia were a series of protests that took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, between December 1999 and April 2000 in response to the privatization of the city's municipal water supply company Semapa. The wave of demonstrations and police violence was described as a public uprising against water prices.
- The tensions erupted when a new firm, Aguas del Tunari – a joint venture involving Bechtel – was required to invest in construction of long-envisioned dam (a priority of Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa) - so they had dramatically raised water rates. Protests, largely organized through the Coordinadora in Defense of Water and Life, a community coalition, erupted in January, February, and April 2000, culminating in tens of thousands marching downtown and battling police. One civilian was killed. On April 10, 2000, the national government reached an agreement with the Coordinadora to reverse the privatization. A complaint filed by foreign investors was resolved by agreement in January 2006.

SCENES OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO YOU. BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE OF INTEREST AND WHAT STRUCK YOU ABOUT THEM:

- In the present day, water was the gold. Water was being taken away from the natives and access was closed off by officials.
- Water was something to be owned (as seen by the protests like “are you going to take away our air too?”). There were uproars and protests, violence and beatings, and dangerous fighting in the streets (like the violence of the natives portrayed by some of the images we studied earlier in the semester). One image that stuck with me was the man walking through the destroyed streets with the bell, saying “stop fighting, the water is yours”.
- The water given to Costa by Daniel was extremely symbolic at the end, giving Costa essentially the natives life in a bottle.
