The second is what I call an Epigraph Paper. For this paper you will choose a passage or image from any work we’ve read or viewed this semester that you think speaks to a major theme, issue, or concern of the course that is of particular interest to you and which you think could serve as an epigraph for the course and what you learned from it. You will then discuss this quotation/image in relationship to at least a few works from the course. The objective of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to think about the works and issues we’ve discussed in relationship to each other and to reflect on how the works for this course have given you new ways to think about early modern globalization. This response paper will be approximately three pages (a minimum of 900 words).

"Why do you allow it? Are you savages that you permit something like that? Look at you: you've had some education; you should know better. How will your country ever progress if you carry on doing these things. You've been to Europe; you've seen how advanced they are. Now tell me: have you ever seen them burning their dead? ... They're not ignorant people. They're advanced, they're educated, they have science, they have guns and tanks and bombs" (235).
