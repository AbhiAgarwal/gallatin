### Essay

It was incredibly interesting to see the market dominance China had with the New World so early on, and how the Europeans were middlemen to establishing these trading routes. Flynn and Giraldez write, "Europeans were intermediaries in the trade between the New World and China ... [estimating] 150 tons of silver passed through Europe into Asia on an annual basis" (213). This was fascinating to me since for China it was an extension of the Silk Road to the New World. In addition, "China was responsible for a power shift within early modern Europe. In the absence of the 'silverization' of China, it is hard to imagine how Castile could have financed simultaneous wars for generations against the Ottomans in the Mediterranean" (214), and "end-customer China created profitable trade in the New World, and profitable trade in America created the demand for African slaves" (216). I believe that the authors are claiming that he trade routes established created a capitalistic mindset for slaves in the American economy, which is a problematic argument. It feels like the argument is a little far fetched as it considers a very micro view of the economy at that time.
