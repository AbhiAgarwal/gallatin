### Essay

I found it interesting to consider how interesting of a character Caliban is when you're exploring him different perspectives of different issues. The poem painted and depicted him in a very different light to how I saw in initially. The poem is particularly interesting for a variety of reasons -- one being the repetitions of particular words, such as "ninety-five", "down", "limbo", "long dark", and many other words. I imagine the repetitions to signify the idea of revolutions and the same events and problems having over and over again. The dates as well as the text tell us a lot about the place and time it was written for -- Cuba. The Cuban Revolution began. Words like "In Havana" help signify that better as well.
