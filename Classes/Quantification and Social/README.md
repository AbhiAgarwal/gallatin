Description
In an age of “big data,” “sabermetrics,” and “evidence-based medicine,” statistical concepts and mathematical models for decision-making have become ever more common in the modern world. Although proponents would argue that these new methods are increasingly powerful, their use raises complicated questions about how decisions can and should be made, in realms from drafting a baseball player to measuring the effectiveness of a federal program. This course examines the history of quantification from the Renaissance to the present, with special attention to the ways new technologies and methodologies intersect with changing notions of rationality and causality. Topics include medicine, population statistics, legal contracts, philosophy, professional sports and gambling. Readings may include Bernoulli, Quetelet, Durkheim, Hacking, Porter.
