%% OUTLINE %%
% Define intelligence
% Show that individuals do it
% Show where it came from
% Show why academics wanted to do it - AI community, machine learning

% Look at Machine Learning aspects 
% Look at Jeff Hawkins approach
% Look at traditional approaches to machine learning

% Look at the aims and problems that Jeff Hawkins and traditional approaches are trying to solve
% Are the aims different? 

% What are their approaches?
% Do they try do the same thing?

% Is it better to Quantify intelligence either way?
% Why are we as humans the intelligence standard they look up to? Are we what they want intelligence to be?
% They are trying to replicate our understanding and how we learn, and how our brain does intelligence - is that right? Here Jeff Hawkins is in the argument
% Others are trying to find an objective definition of intelligence, and trying to approach intelligence from a perspective of mathematics and trying to look at all the variables that make up intelligence.  Looking at features "what they call it in machine learning", and trying to simulate these

% DEFINING INTELLIGENCE

% Intelligence build-up
\par 
% What is intelligence? 
% Trying to show that everyone quantifies intelligence for some reason
% Show why the intelligence community wanted to quantify intelligence. 
Intelligence has been defined as many different things, and each of these definitions have allowed us to quantify or understand intelligence in a different way. The simple act of telling people how intelligent she is, is the most basic act of quantifying intelligence that we do. By stating that a particular individual is intelligent we could mean a couple things. A person's intelligence can be defined to be the knowledge gained, the accomplishments, the ability to understand other individuals, their community/society, their an ability to reason, and much more. These are certain characteristics that we think about when making a judgement about an individual's intelligence, and the major of society does this. The most intelligent individuals part-take in this as well by accepting awards that claim they have a high IQ, and less intelligent individuals part-take in this by observing this phenomenon.

Therefore, there is an inherit part of us through our perception of the world that needs to try and judge intelligence.

% Quantifying intelligence - what it is and how we can do it
\par The idea of trying to quantify intelligence or measuring intelligence was first introduced by the field of phrenology, and Franz Joseph Gall who is known to be the founder of the field. Franz Joseph Gall wanted to try study the localization of the mental functions in the brain by observing skull sizes, and facial features of people. Even though the field of phrenology wasn't ultimately success, some of the concepts such as attempting to quantify intelligence intrigued the scientific community.

\par Intelligence and why create a framework for intelligence?

% DEFINING APPLICATIONS OF INTELLIGENCE

% Defining/explaining/understanding intelligence
\par How people have quantified intelligence in the past - IQ tests. Done by powerful individuals for gains (help recruitment for military).
\par ``Artificial Intelligence (AI) was the first large scientific community, established already in the mid 1950s, working on problems that require intelligence to be solved" (W\l{}odzis\l{}aw, 1).
\par Quantifying and defining intelligence and frameworks around it became important when


% DEFINING INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORKS
% ASPECTS/CHARACTERISTICS OF INTELLIGENCE AND HOW THEY ARE APPLIED BY EACH FRAMEWORK
% i.e.: HOW IS REASONING DONE IN EACH? IN THE MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATION REASONING IS DONE BY BOOLEAN SATISFIABILITY PROBLEMS.

% One way of defining Intelligence in Machine Learning
\par Hawkins is an electrical engineer, and hasn't had any professional experience in neuroscience. His framework approaches the problem from an engineer's perspective as well as his personal study of the research done on the cerebral cortex to formulate his framework.
\par Jeff Hawkin's Intelligence

% Next way of defining intelligence in Machine Learning
\par Intelligence in the Machine Learning community with just a mathematical training
