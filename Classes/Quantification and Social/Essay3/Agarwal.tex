% DEFINING INTELLIGENCE
% Intelligence build-up
% What is intelligence? 
% Define intelligence
\par Intelligence has been defined as many different things, and each of these definitions have allowed us to quantify or understand intelligence in a different way. The simple act of telling people how intelligent she is, is the most basic act of quantifying intelligence that we do day-to-day. By stating that a particular individual is intelligent we could mean a couple things. For example, we could be commenting on the ability to gain knowledge at speed, their accomplishments, their society/community group, their an ability to reason, and much more. 
% Show that individuals do it
These are certain characteristics that we think about when making a judgement about an individual's intelligence, and the majority of society does this. The most intelligent individuals part-take in this by accepting awards that claim they have a high IQ such as high IQ society awards or genius grants, and less intelligent individuals part-take in this as well by observing this phenomenon and participating by discussing it. Therefore, there is an inherit part of our society and the way we perceive of the world that needs to compare or judge intelligence.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Quantifying intelligence - what it is and how we can do it

% Show where it came from
\par The idea of trying to quantify intelligence or measuring intelligence was first introduced by the field of Phrenology, and Franz Joseph Gall who is known to be the founder of the field. Gall wanted to try study the localization of the mental functions in the brain by observing skull sizes, and facial features of people. Even though the field of Phrenology wasn't ultimately success, some of the concepts such as attempting to quantify intelligence intrigued the scientific community. Moreover, another individual we studied in class that tried to attempt to define intellectual ability was Samuel George Morton. Morton, similarly, in his work Crania Americana claimed in his paper that you could measure the intellectual ability of a race by their skull capacity. 

% Defining/explaining/understanding intelligence
\par This idea become more popular when Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon, in France, designed the first wide-used intelligence test known as the Binet-Simon Scale. Binet personally believed that intelligence is too broad of a concept to quantify with a single numerical value. However, he did agree that intelligence is influenced by a number of factors, and can be compared if broken down into its parts. In 1916, the Binet-Simon Scale was brought to the U.S. to Stanford University and researchers adapted it to become the Intelligent Quotient or IQ. The reason for the U.S. to create an intelligent test, as we read in class, was to screen army recruits during World War 1. In addition, IQ tests were also used to screen immigrants as they arrived at Ellis island, and became increasingly more useful to governments as the century progressed. 

\par Throughout the 20th century the IQ test was used to filter out individuals in different ways. It has been used to filter individuals for prizes and grants, for military and government recruitment, in medicine, job interviews, universities, and much more. We're depended on ways to quantify intelligence in order to pick individuals out, and narrow down our search fields in the same way we have used strength or speed. It's becoming increasingly more important as we move from jobs being in the primary and secondary sector to the tertiary sector. 

% Show why academics wanted to do it - AI community, machine learning
\par In the same way in Computer Science there has been a big push from giant organizations to make computers increasingly more intelligent to help reduce costs. This push, as well as a goal for Computer Scientists to create artificial life, has driven Computer Scientists to define intelligence. Since the development of computers there has been a vision of creating an intelligent agent, and the community of individuals studying Artificial Intelligence have had a vision and different approaches to solving this problem. An intelligent agent is an autonomous entity that is goal driven and uses previous knowledge or learns to reach its goal.

\par In 2007 W\l{}odzis\l{}aw published a paper on computational intelligence, and wrote ``Artificial Intelligence (AI) was the first large scientific community, established already in the mid 1950s, working on problems that require intelligence to be solved" (W\l{}odzis\l{}aw, 1). Intelligence is important to the field because it's an inherent part of building artificial life, and to build systems that mimic human life. Most of the Artificial Intelligence community is still debating on ways to solve this problem as building an intelligent agent inherently requires a mathematical or computational definition of intelligence. It's required in order for the intelligent agent to learn, and be able to make intelligent decisions on its own. Building an intelligent agent requires for us to define a program algorithmically that would allow it to act autonomously, and in order to do that we need some methodology or steps that it could follow to learn.

\par Given the limitations in terms of computational power in pre-2000, research in building an intelligent agent branched of into two perspectives. The first was looking at this problem from a mathematical perspective, and the second was exploring neuroscience and the human anatomy to apply the principles of our intelligence to building an intelligent agent. Building an intelligent agent from a mathematical perspective is looking at features, or aspects of intelligence and trying to model them mathematical in order to later bring them together into one coherent model. The latter looks at how our cerebral cortex was formed and borrows the architecture and the way neurons make connections between things we learn to apply the same methodology to learning as our brain does. Since we are trying to mimic human beings in creating intelligent agents the theory of learning from our brains became a desirable theory in the community. 

\par During the next decade individuals worked on advancing these fields theoretically until they reached a point where processing power would catch up with their research. The decade gave both the branches time to grow their communities and to improve traction around their work, and this created a separation in ideology and the way individuals dealt with the aspects of quantifying intelligence.

\par In order to understand the task of building an algorithm that does learning, it needs to be explicitly stated what learning is and how a computer is able to achieve this task of learning. This particular task falls into a field that started within the field of Artificial Intelligence called Machine Learning. ``Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuff. We might, for instance, be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate predictions, or to behave intelligently" (Schapire, 1). The basic process of Machine Learning is the training of the algorithm. In the training process, the algorithm is fed some data, for example data about the weather, whilst attaching details of the outcome. An example of this would be to see if it rained given that the temperature was 4'C and it was cloudy. The algorithm would use the fact that it rained when it was 4'C and it was cloudy in the future to make a prediction when you give it a similar scenario. In summary, ``machine learning is about learning to do better in the future based on what was experienced in the past" (Schapire, 1).

\par Prediction is key in Machine Learning because it's not certain that it will rain given the weather conditions outside, but it's returning the most likely answer. This particular type of algorithm is called a classification algorithm where it's using some detail to classify it into a set number of options: sunny, rainy, etc. A learning algorithm would work the same way, you would teach it how to react in certain scenarios and their outcomes, and it would be able to associate things you teach it together. Learning algorithms are extremely flexible, and there are many ways to approach them. Both the task of defining intelligence mathematically, and through neuroscience approach the problem from a Machine Learning prospective because this allows us to teach the computer without explicitly having to program it into the computer. Machine Learning can be done in many ways as the basic principle of taking in data and returning a prediction applies across all the algorithms, but what you do in the middle to find the best prediction is what differentiates the methodology.
