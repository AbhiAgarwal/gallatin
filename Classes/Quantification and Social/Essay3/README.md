### OUTLINE 

#### Part 1

- Define intelligence
- Show that individuals do it
- Show where it came from
- Show why academics wanted to do it - AI community, machine learning

#### Part 2

- Look at Machine Learning aspects 
- Look at Jeff Hawkins approach
- Look at traditional approaches to machine learning

#### Part 2

- Look at the aims and problems that Jeff Hawkins and traditional approaches are trying to solve
- Are the aims different? 

#### Part 3

- What are their approaches?
- Do they try do the same thing?

#### Part 4

- Is it better to Quantify intelligence either way?
- Why are we as humans the intelligence standard they look up to? Are we what they want intelligence to be?
- They are trying to replicate our understanding and how we learn, and how our brain does intelligence - is that right? Here Jeff Hawkins is in the argument
- Others are trying to find an objective definition of intelligence, and trying to approach intelligence from a perspective of mathematics and trying to look at all the variables that make up intelligence.  Looking at features "what they call it in machine learning", and trying to simulate these

### IDSEM-UG1760: Quantification and Social Thought
### Fall 2014
### Final Project

Due: December 17th by 5pm in hardcopy to my mailbox in 411 Lafayette
Worth: 25% of final grade

The final project is meant to be the culmination of both your reading in this course and your own engagement with a topic of your choice. That is, it is meant to prompt you to bring the questions, approaches, and concerns that we’ve been talking about in this course to bear on a different topic that we’ve not yet discussed but that is of concern to you. This might be something akin to one of the areas we’ve discussed, like looking at a different professional sport’s use of statistics or the role of quantification in the law; or it might be in a completely different field entirely. It is up to you. Follow your interests.

To complete the project, you should gather a relatively small cache of sources that enable you to make an argument about your topic. These could, for example, be a set of sources that document a new development in the field that involves quantification in some way, and what you’re interested in is the way in which this is portrayed. Or, they could be a set of advertisements or descriptions of a particular tool for sale that is meant to help measure something. There are many possible avenues of approach, and you need not delve into deep history--you can choose something very recent, or even ongoing. The catch is that the assignment does not ask for a journalistic approach. That is, you’re not being asked to give an account of what is going on in a particular field, say, but rather to analyze the topic with your “historian hat” on, thinking about how this particular development fits in with the long history of attempts to use numbers and calculations to make claims. It is not necessary, or expected, to bring what we’ve read explicitly into conversation with your topic (unless it’s relevant), but rather, to use what we’ve done this semester as groundwork for your own analysis.

The write-up should be about 3500-5000 words, excluding notes (for reference, if writing in Times New Roman, with 12pt font, 1” margins and double spacing, this is about 12-15 pages), although it is more important to convincingly argue your case than it is to use a certain number of words. You should, however, pick a set of sources and topic that can be successfully analyzed in approximately this length. As with all assignments, you should properly cite your sources.

To ensure you are on the right track, you have to meet with me to discuss your outline and progress prior to the end of day on Monday December 15th.
