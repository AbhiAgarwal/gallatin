Background

Hume caused a stir by advocating a system of morality based on utility, or usefulness, instead of God’s authority.

Hume argued that all knowledge results from our experiences and is not received from God or innate to our minds.
    - This kind of empiricism led to today’s “scientific method,” which holds that knowledge should be based on observations rather than intuition or faith. Radical empiricism went further, arguing that our knowledge is nothing more than the sum of our experiences.
    - Unlike Locke and Berkeley, Hume removed God from the equation completely and argued forcefully against the possibility of his existence as his contemporaries envisioned it.

Themes

- The Uncertainty of Causation
    - Hume observes that while we may perceive two events that seem to occur in conjunction, there is no way for us to know the nature of their connection.
    - Hume claims that causation is a habit of association, a belief that is unfounded and meaningless.
    - Hume holds that we have an instinctive belief in causality, rooted in our own biological habits, and that we can neither prove nor discount this belief.
    - However, if we accept our limitations, we can still function without abandoning our assumptions about cause and effect. Religion suggests that the world operates on cause and effect and that there must therefore be a First Cause, namely God. In Hume’s worldview, causation is assumed but ultimately unknowable. We do not know there is a First Cause, or a place for God.

- The Problem of Induction
    - Induction is the practice of drawing general conclusions based on particular experiences.
    - Although this method is essential to empiricism and the scientific method, there is always something inherently uncertain about it, because we may acquire new data that are different and that disprove our previous conclusions.
    - *Essentially, the principle of induction teaches us that we can predict the future based on what has happened in the past, which we cannot.*
    - Hume allows that we can still use induction, like causation, to function on a daily basis as long as we recognize the limitations of our knowledge.

- Religious Morality Versus Moral Utility
    - Hume proposes the idea that moral principles are rooted in their utility, or usefulness, rather than in God’s will.
    - Hume did not think that moral truths could be arrived at scientifically, as if we could add together units of utility and compare the relative utility of various actions. Instead, Hume was a moral sentimentalist who believed that moral principles cannot be intellectually justified as scientific solutions to social problems.
    - Hume argues that some principles simply appeal to us and others do not. Moral principles appeal to us because they promote our interests and those of our fellow human beings, with whom we naturally sympathize.
    - In other words, humans are biologically inclined to approve and support whatever helps society, since we all live in a community and stand to benefit. Hume used this simple but controversial insight to explain how we evaluate a wide array of phenomena, from social institutions and government policies to character traits and individual behavior.

- The Division of Reason and Morality
    - Hume denies that reason plays a determining role in motivating or discouraging behavior. Instead, he believes that the determining factor in human behavior is passion.
    - As proof, he asks us to evaluate human actions according to the criterion of “instrumentalism”—that is, whether an action serves the agent’s purpose.
    - Generally, we see that they do not and that human beings tend to act out of some other motivation than their best interest.
    - Based on these arguments, Hume concludes that reason alone cannot motivate anyone to act.
    - Rather, reason helps us arrive at judgments, but our own desires motivate us to act on or ignore those judgments.
    - Therefore, reason does not form the basis of morality—it plays the role of an advisor rather than that of a decision-maker. Likewise, immorality is immoral not because it violates reason but because it is displeasing to us.
    - By removing reason from its throne, Hume denied God’s role as the source of morality.

- Finding God in an Orderly Universe
    - Hume argues that an orderly universe does not necessarily prove the existence of God. Those who hold the opposing view claim that God is the creator of the universe and the source of the order and purpose we observe in it, which resemble the order and purpose we ourselves create.
    - Therefore, God, as creator of the universe, must possess intelligence similar, though superior, to ours. Hume explains that for this argument to hold up, it must be true that order and purpose appear only as a direct result of design.

- The Bundle Theory of the Self
    - Hume asks us to consider what impression gives us our concept of self. We tend to think of ourselves as selves—stable entities that exist over time.
    - But no matter how closely we examine our own experiences, we never observe anything beyond a series of transient feelings, sensations, and impressions.
    - We cannot observe ourselves, or what we are, in a unified way. There is no impression of the “self” that ties our particular impressions together. In other words, we can never be directly aware of ourselves, only of what we are experiencing at any given moment.
    - Although the relations between our ideas, feelings, and so on, may be traced through time by memory, there is no real evidence of any core that connects them. This argument also applies to the concept of the soul.
    - Hume suggests that the self is just a bundle of perceptions, like links in a chain. To look for a unifying self beyond those perceptions is like looking for a chain apart from the links that constitute it. Hume argues that our concept of the self is a result of our natural habit of attributing unified existence to any collection of associated parts. This belief is natural, but there is no logical support for it.

Summary, Book I: “Of the Understanding”

- Part 1: Of ideas, their origin, composition, connexion, abstraction, etc.

Hume begins by arguing for the validity of empiricism, the premise that all of our knowledge is based on our experiences, and using this method to examine several philosophical concepts.
