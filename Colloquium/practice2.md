### Sidereus Nuncius – Galileo Galilei

It was the first published scientific work based on observations made through a telescope, and it contains the results of Galileo's early observations of the imperfect and mountainous Moon, the hundreds of stars that were unable to be seen in either the Milky Way or certain constellations with the naked eye, and the Medicean Stars that appeared to be circling Jupiter.

The Latin word nuncius was typically used during this time period to denote messenger; however, it was also (though less frequently) rendered as message. Though the title Sidereus Nuncius is usually translated into English as Sidereal Messenger, many of Galileo's early drafts of the book and later related writings indicate that the intended purpose of the book was "simply to report the news about recent developments in astronomy, not to pass himself off solemnly as an ambassador from heaven." Therefore, the correct English translation of the title is Sidereal Message (or often, Starry Message).

### The Discourse on Method – Rene Descartes (Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences)

A revolution in the full sense of that word: an old worldview was overturned and rejected in favor of a new, very different worldview.

- This new worldview was based on hypothesis and experiment, on reducing scientific phenomena to a very few, simple mathematical formulae.
- The old worldview was Aristotelian scholasticism: a worldview closely tied to the Catholic Church, which had been the exclusive seat of learning in the West since the fall of the Roman Empire.
    - The Aristotelian worldview was based on reason and logical deduction. Truth was something that could be known with certainty and deduced from other self-evident truths.

The old worldview of Aristotelian scholasticism was not going to go down without a fight. Many of the advocates of the new science—Descartes and Galileo being two notable cases—still used much of the language and terminology of the Catholic academics.

Descartes claims to have found a particularly effective method of guiding his reason that has helped him to make many significant discoveries in his scientific research. He undertakes to explain his method by means of autobiography: he tells the story of his intellectual development and of how he came upon this method.

#### Part I: Various considerations touching the Sciences

Descartes begins by allowing himself some wit:

> Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess.

> Hobbes: "But this proveth rather that men are in that point equal, than unequal. For there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share."

Descartes continues with a warning:

> For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.

- Descartes opens by asserting that everyone is equally well endowed with reason.
- Following scholastic philosophy, he claims that we are essentially rational animals, and while we may differ with respect to our accidental, or non-essential, properties, we must all share the same form, or essential properties.
- Since we are all equally human, we must all be equally rational. People have different opinions and arrive at the truth with varying degrees of success not because some people are better equipped with reason than others but because different people apply their reason in different ways.
- Instead, Descartes decided to abandon his books and see what he could learn in traveling the world. He learnt that people have all sorts of different customs, and what might seem strange in his native France is well accepted in great nations abroad. This helped him to mistrust anything that he had learned simply through custom and example and to trust his reason above all.
    - One day, Descartes resolved to pursue studies within himself rather than in the world, to look inward and see what he could dig out by means of his reason. In this study, he feels he has had far greater success than anything he has learned from books or traveling.
- Descartes describes a growing trend in the youth of his generation, something that Thomas Kuhn calls a "paradigm shift."
- There was a growing dissatisfaction with, and skepticism toward, the scholastic philosophy that had been inherited from Aristotle.
- Rather, people grew dissatisfied with a paradigm of knowledge, of an understanding of what knowledge was, of how it could be learned, and of what value it could have.
    - Aristotelian logic, and hence Aristotelian science, works according to a method of syllogism and demonstration: One starts with a premise that one knows with certainty by means of intuition, and then one deduces consequences from it by means of a syllogism. A syllogism is a kind of logical argument with three steps and three terms.
- According to Aristotle, and to the two thousand-year old tradition that used his ideas, scientific knowledge is certain knowledge deduced from certain premises.
- Aristotelian scholasticism was not overthrown by a set of scientific discoveries. Rather, these discoveries were a result of a revolution in the way we think about science.
    - Galileo and Descartes were two of the early exponents of a new scientific method that relies on hypothesis and experiment rather than on demonstration and syllogism.
        - For instance, one of the main arguments the Inquisition made against Galileo was that his claim that the earth went around the sun was not demonstrated knowledge.
        - They were perfectly happy to accept that it was a plausible theoretical model, but they were trapped in an ancient worldview according to which theoretical models and demonstrations of certainty were two very different things.
        - Galileo was accused of claiming that his model was a demonstration of certainty rather than a theoretical model.
- Descartes not only must pay lip service to Aristotelian philosophy, but he also has not entirely freed himself from that mindset.
    - For instance, we find him arguing early on that we are all equally rational because reason is a form, and not an accident, of human nature. The distinction between form and accident is quintessentially Aristotelian.

#### Part II: The principal rules of the Method which the Author has discovered

- He first mused that accomplishments of single individuals are usually more perfect than group efforts.
    - Cities and buildings are more beautiful when they are made according to a single plan than when they are patched together piecemeal.
    - Descartes is very careful, first of all, to point out that this method is meant only on an individual level, and he strongly opposes those who would try to topple a public institution and rebuild it from the ground up.
- Before abandoning his former opinions entirely, Descartes formulates four laws that will direct his inquiry:

1. Not to accept anything as true unless it is evident; this will prevent hasty conclusions.
2. To divide any given problem into the greatest possible number of parts to make for a simpler analysis.
3. To start with the simplest of objects and to slowly progress toward increasingly difficult objects of study.
4. To be circumspect and constantly review the progress made in order to be sure that nothing has been left out.

An obvious starting place was in the mathematical sciences, where a great deal of progress and certain knowledge had been achieved by means of demonstration. Descartes found his work made considerably easier if, on the one hand, he considered every quantity as a line, and, on the other hand, developed a system of symbols that could express these quantities as concisely as possible. Taking the best elements of algebra and geometry, he had tremendous success in both these fields.

The theory states that if we were to analyze any complex proposition, we could break it down into increasingly smaller, simpler pieces until we were left with simple, non-analyzable propositions

#### Part III: Morals and Maxims accepted while conducting the Method

The first maxim is to remain faithful to the laws and customs of his country and his religion. He acknowledges that this choice is somewhat arbitrary given that he has undertaken to abandon all his former opinions and prejudices.

However, he notes that if he is to get on in his own country while he dismantles his former opinions he would do well to let his actions be guided by customs of his own country rather than those of some foreign nation

-

His second maxim is to remain firm and decisive in his actions. Even a wrong decision is better than indecision, since indecision takes one nowhere.

If there is no obviously true and certain decision to be made, Descartes opts for the most probably right decision, and treats that decision as if it were true and certain.

-

His third maxim is to try to master himself and not external factors, to work to change his desires rather than the world.

-

His fourth maxim is to find the best possible occupation in life. He concludes that following the present method of philosophy is the best he can do.

The third and fourth maxims both suggest that the life of the mind is more valuable than action. A balanced and peaceful mind guarantees a happy life more than any kind of earthly pleasures.

#### Part IV: Proof of God and the Soul

Applying the method to itself, Descartes challenges his own reasoning and reason itself. But Descartes believes three things are not susceptible to doubt and the three support each other to form a stable foundation for the method. He cannot doubt that something has to be there to do the doubting (I think, therefore I am). The method of doubt cannot doubt reason as it is based on reason itself. By reason there exists a God, and God is the guarantor that reason is not misguided.

Perhaps the most strained part of the argument is the reasoned proof of the existence of God, and indeed Descartes seems to realize this as he supplies three different "proofs" including what is now referred to as the negotiable ontological proof of the existence of God.

He abandons all sensory knowledge, since the senses can deceive, all demonstrative reasoning, since people often make errors in their reasoning, and imagines that everything that has ever entered his mind is just illusions brought on by dreams.

This doubt requires thought, and this thought confirms his existence, so he adopts the principle "I am thinking, therefore I exist," as the indubitable foundation upon which he will build.

Since his knowledge of his existence hinges exclusively on his thinking, he concludes that he is essentially a thinking substance, and that his soul is totally distinct from, and easier to know than, the body.

Descartes arrives at another proof of God's existence by way of geometry. He notes the certainty with which geometers can prove facts such as the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. This is part of the essence of a triangle, and yet for all that, there is no assurance that one triangle actually exists in the world. When contemplating God, however, he recognizes that existence is as much an essential property of God's as having three angles that add up to 180 degrees is an essential property of triangles. God's existence is thus as certain as a geometric proof. Descartes remarks that people have difficulty with these proofs because they rely exclusively on their senses and imagination. God's existence can only be perceived by reason, and not by these other two faculties.

In fact, God's existence is more certain than anything else, since all other things are subject to the doubts that Descartes has already raised. These doubts can only be removed by the recognition that God exists. Thanks to God we can be assured that our clear and distinct perceptions are true, since those perceptions come to us from God, and we can rest assured that all our perceptions must be true to the extent to which they are clear and distinct. We perceive clearly and distinctly when we exercise our reason properly, and we are misled when we rely exclusively on our senses or imagination.

Such doubt effectively demolishes the whole enterprise of Aristotelian philosophy, which bases its claims on sensory experience and demonstrative reasoning.

According to Aristotelian philosophy, only reason and understanding are distinctly mental properties. Sensing, imagination, and willing are not simply mental properties, since they connect the mind with objects in the world. Descartes overturns this conception, suggesting that our sense experience, imagination, and will are all a part of the mind alone, and are not linked to the world.

Effectively, Descartes re-conceives the mind as a thing—the source of all the thoughts, sensations, imaginings, and so on that constitute our world—trapped inside our body. How our mind can connect with a world outside this body has been a pressing problem for all modern humans since Hamlet.

Descartes seems to argue in a circle later in his discussion, when he claims that God confirms the truth of clear and distinct perceptions. This implies that without God, clear and distinct perceptions would not be true. But he has only managed to "prove" that God exists by appealing to a clear and distinct perception to that effect. What, then, is the foundation upon which Descartes builds?

If God is the source of all truth, including the truth of clear and distinct perceptions, how can Descartes prove that God exists? And if clear and distinct perceptions are the source of all truth, then what role does God play in all this?

### Logic – Aristotle

Aristotle wrote six works that were later grouped together as the Organon, which means “instrument.” These works are the Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, On Interpretation, Topics, Sophistical Refutations, and Categories. These texts are considered the body of Aristotle’s work on logic, though there is a great deal in the Organon that we would not consider logic, and many of Aristotle’s other works, most notably the Metaphysics, deal to some extent with logic.
