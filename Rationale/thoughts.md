"Mathematical logic prior to 1931 ... began with the attempts to mechanize the thought processes of reasoning" (Hofstadter, 19).

"Essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:

- To respond to situations very flexibly;
- To take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;
- To make sense of ambiguous or contradictory messages;
- To recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation;
- To find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
- To draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;
- To synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;
- To come up with ideas which are novel." (Hofstadter, 26).

"Strange flavor of AI work is that people try to put together long sets of rules in strict formalisms which tell inflexible machines how to be flexible" (Hofstadter, 26).

"Computers by their very nature are the most inflexible, desire-less, rule-following of beasts" (Hofstadter, 26).

"The flexibility of intelligence comes from the enormous number of different rules, and levels of rules. The reason that so many rules on so many different levels must exist is that in life, a creature is faced with millions of situations of completely different types" (Hofstadter, 27).
